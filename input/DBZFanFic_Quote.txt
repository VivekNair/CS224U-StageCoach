9-9	Warm.

11-12	Woman. Woman, rise.

15-16	Ah, Vegeta. I'm so sorry For oversleeping.

19-20	What are you doing? If you're tired, keep sleeping.

23-23	Well, you woke me up in the first place!

26-26	I just wanted to be sure you were alright

30-30	I have a lot to do. I've got meals to start, research to do, prototypes to build

33-34	Well, that'll all have to wait. I will handle meals until further notice, and you shall say in bed.

37-38	Women don't go on bed rest until their due any moment! I need to be productive while I still can!

41-41	You may not compromise yours and the baby's health for your entertainment.

44-44	Vegeta, nobody's health is-

46-46	V-Vegeta

47-49	Woman! Bulma! Bulma, hang on!

61-61	Chi Chi.

69-69	ALRIGHT, ALRIGHT!

74-74	Kakarot let you get fat?

77-79	No, stupid. Kakarot made me fat. I'm pregnant!

84-84	Oh, great.

89-89	Let me just go get Goku so you too can spar or some-

89-89	I need you.

92-92	ME?

93-93	I actually need your help.

96-96	Alright. I'll help, I guess

99-99	Do you plan on inviting me in?

101-101	Goku!

102-102	Coming!

104-105	Vegeta! What are you doing here without Bulma?

108-108	She's why I'm here.

111-113	Bulma? What do you need, Vegeta? We'll do it.

116-117	It's the pregnancy. I'm worried it may not be going well.

119-119	Why not?

121-122	She's been sapped of all her energy. She's been in bed and suffered severe pains in her stomach You.

124-124	I have no recollection of female Saiyajins and have witnessed no births but you have bared a half-Saiyan.

128-128	Well To be honest I'm not sure if that's normal or if Bulma's in trouble.

131-132	Around her time of pregnancy I really began to feel the effects of carrying Gohan. His needs in my womb far surpassed any human child's and he would actually take them from me, depleting me of energy and vitamins.

134-134	There were times when I thought I was dying, honestly. Either I had no energy or the pain was so great I told Goku if I passed away to make sure to get Gohan no matter how many weeks early

138-139	And child birth was brutal. Chi Chi lost a lot of blood, and once Gohan was born she was unconscious for three days and bed ridden for a week and a half.

142-142	You can basically expect what we've told you.

144-144	But even if you expect, never fail to be by Bulma's side and tell her that That you love her.

146-146	And in the worst case scenario To rescue the baby from her sto-

146-146	Enough.

149-149	How did you and Kakarot succeed, tell me and I shall do it!

152-152	There's nothing we did Vegeta.

154-156	It was hard.. But, but Chi Chi survived. All you can do is be there every step of the way and-

158-158	It's Bulma

159-159	Her ki is fluctuating, I have to-

159-159	I'll go.

162-162	I will too!

164-165	Easy, Chi Chi. You ought to rest, Vegeta and I will take care of Bulma!

168-168	Let's go.
