6-6	She regretted to be under the necessity of keeping me at a distance; but that until she heard from Bessie, and could discover by her own observation, that I was endeavouring in good earnest to acquire a more sociable and childlike disposition, a more attractive and sprightly manner--something lighter, franker, more natural, as it were--she really must exclude me from privileges intended only for contented, happy, little children.

7-7	What does Bessie say I have done?

9-10	Jane, I don't like cavillers or questioners; besides, there is something truly forbidding in a child taking up her elders in that manner.  Be seated somewhere; and until you can speak pleasantly, remain silent.

18-18	the solitary rocks and promontories

18-18	Where the Northern Ocean, in vast whirls,    Boils round the naked, melancholy isles    Of farthest Thule; and the Atlantic surge    Pours in among the stormy Hebrides.

19-19	the vast sweep of the Arctic Zone, and those forlorn regions of dreary space,--that reservoir of frost and snow, where firm fields of ice, the accumulation of centuries of winters, glazed in Alpine heights above heights, surround the pole, and concentre the multiplied rigours of extreme cold.

31-32	Boh!  Madam Mope!

34-34	Where the dickens is she!

36-38	Lizzy!  Georgy! (calling to his sisters) Joan is not here: tell mama she is run out into the rain--bad animal!

2-2	It is well I drew the curtain,

39-39	She is in the window-seat, to be sure, Jack.

41-41	What do you want?

43-43	Say, 'What do you want, Master Reed?'

45-45	I want you to come here;

48-48	on account of his delicate health.

2-2	That is for your impudence in answering mama awhile since,

58-58	and for your sneaking way of getting behind curtains, and for the look you had in your eyes two minutes since, you rat!

60-60	What were you doing behind the curtain?

62-62	I was reading.

63-63	Show the book.

65-67	You have no business to take our books; you are a dependent, mama says; you have no money; your father left you none; you ought to beg, and not to live here with gentlemen's children like us, and eat the same meals we do, and wear clothes at our mama's expense.  Now, I'll teach you to rummage my bookshelves: for they _are_ mine; all the house belongs to me, or will do in a few years.  Go and stand by the door, out of the way of the mirror and the windows.

70-70	Wicked and cruel boy!

72-72	You are like a murderer--you are like a slave-driver--you are like the Roman emperors!

75-76	What! what!

78-80	Did she say that to me?  Did you hear her, Eliza and Georgiana?  Won't I tell mama? but first--

84-85	Rat!  Rat!

89-91	Dear! dear!  What a fury to fly at Master John!

92-92	Did ever anybody see such a picture of passion!

94-94	Take her away to the red-room, and lock her in there.

98-98	Hold her arms, Miss Abbot: she's like a mad cat.

99-100	For shame! for shame!

102-103	What shocking conduct, Miss Eyre, to strike a young gentleman, your benefactress's son!  Your young master.

104-106	Master!  How is he my master?  Am I a servant?

107-108	No; you are less than a servant, for you do nothing for your keep. There, sit down, and think over your wickedness.

2-2	If you don't sit still, you must be tied down,

112-112	Miss Abbot, lend me your garters; she would break mine directly.

2-2	Don't take them off,

115-115	I will not stir.

2-2	Mind you don't,

2-2	She never did so before,

2-2	But it was always in her,

120-121	I've told Missis often my opinion about the child, and Missis agreed with me.  She's an underhand little thing: I never saw a girl of her age with so much cover.

122-123	You ought to be aware, Miss, that you are under obligations to Mrs. Reed: she keeps you: if she were to turn you off, you would have to go to the poorhouse.

126-127	And you ought not to think yourself on an equality with the Misses Reed and Master Reed, because Missis kindly allows you to be brought up with them.  They will have a great deal of money, and you will have none: it is your place to be humble, and to try to make yourself agreeable to them.

2-2	What we tell you is for your good,

128-128	you should try to be useful and pleasant, then, perhaps, you would have a home here; but if you become passionate and rude, Missis will send you away, I am sure.

2-2	Besides,

129-131	God will punish her: He might strike her dead in the midst of her tantrums, and then where would she go?  Come, Bessie, we will leave her: I wouldn't have her heart for anything.  Say your prayers, Miss Eyre, when you are by yourself; for if you don't repent, something bad might be permitted to come down the chimney and fetch you away.

151-151	old girl,

157-157	her own darling.

160-161	Unjust!--unjust!

198-198	Miss Eyre, are you ill?

200-201	What a dreadful noise! it went quite through me!

203-204	Take me out!  Let me go into the nursery!

206-208	What for?  Are you hurt?  Have you seen something?

210-211	Oh!  I saw a light, and I thought a ghost would come.

2-2	She has screamed out on purpose,

214-215	And what a scream!  If she had been in great pain one would have excused it, but she only wanted to bring us all here: I know her naughty tricks.

216-216	What is all this?

219-219	Abbot and Bessie, I believe I gave orders that Jane Eyre should be left in the red-room till I came to her myself.

2-2	Miss Jane screamed so loud, ma'am,

2-2	Let her go,

222-223	Loose Bessie's hand, child: you cannot succeed in getting out by these means, be assured.  I abhor artifice, particularly in children; it is my duty to show you that tricks will not answer: you will now stay here an hour longer, and it is only on condition of perfect submission and stillness that I shall liberate you then.

224-227	O aunt! have pity!  Forgive me!  I cannot endure it--let me be punished some other way!  I shall be killed if--

228-228	Silence!  This violence is all most repulsive:

245-245	Well, who am I?

247-247	We shall do very well by-and-by.

250-250	Do you feel as if you should sleep, Miss?

253-253	I will try.

254-254	Would you like to drink, or could you eat anything?

255-255	No, thank you, Bessie.

256-256	Then I think I shall go to bed, for it is past twelve o'clock; but you may call me if you want anything in the night.

259-260	Bessie, what is the matter with me?  Am I ill?

261-261	You fell sick, I suppose, in the red-room with crying; you'll be better soon, no doubt.

263-264	Sarah, come and sleep with me in the nursery; I daren't for my life be alone with that poor child to-night: she might die; it's such a strange thing she should have that fit: I wonder if she saw anything.  Missis was rather too hard.

2-2	Something passed her, all dressed in white, and vanished

4-4	A great black dog behind him

6-6	Three loud raps on the chamber door

8-8	A light in the churchyard just over his grave,

290-290	In the days when we went gipsying,       A long time ago.

292-292	A long time ago

295-295	My feet they are sore, and my limbs they are weary;       Long is the way, and the mountains are wild;    Soon will the twilight close moonless and dreary       Over the path of the poor orphan child.

301-301	

2-2	Come, Miss Jane, don't cry,

302-302	don't burn!

306-306	What, already up!

308-308	Well, nurse, how is she?

310-311	Then she ought to look more cheerful.  Come here, Miss Jane: your name is Jane, is it not?

312-312	Yes, sir, Jane Eyre.

313-314	Well, you have been crying, Miss Jane Eyre; can you tell me what about? Have you any pain?

315-315	No, sir.

316-316	Oh!  I daresay she is crying because she could not go out with Missis in the carriage,

318-319	Surely not! why, she is too old for such pettishness.

320-321	I never cried for such a thing in my life: I hate going out in the carriage.  I cry because I am miserable.

322-322	Oh fie, Miss!

326-326	What made you ill yesterday?

2-2	She had a fall,

328-331	Fall! why, that is like a baby again!  Can't she manage to walk at her age?  She must be eight or nine years old.

2-2	I was knocked down,

4-4	but that did not make me ill,

335-335	That's for you, nurse,

335-335	you can go down; I'll give Miss Jane a lecture till you come back.

337-337	The fall did not make you ill; what did, then?

340-340	I was shut up in a room where there is a ghost till after dark.

343-345	Ghost!  What, you are a baby after all!  You are afraid of ghosts?

346-348	Of Mr. Reed's ghost I am: he died in that room, and was laid out there. Neither Bessie nor any one else will go into it at night, if they can help it; and it was cruel to shut me up alone without a candle,--so cruel that I think I shall never forget it.

349-351	Nonsense!  And is it that makes you so miserable?  Are you afraid now in daylight?

352-352	No: but night will come again before long: and besides,--I am unhappy,--very unhappy, for other things.

353-354	What other things?  Can you tell me some of them?

359-359	For one thing, I have no father or mother, brothers or sisters.

360-360	You have a kind aunt and cousins.

361-361	But John Reed knocked me down, and my aunt shut me up in the red-room.

364-364	Don't you think Gateshead Hall a very beautiful house?

366-366	Are you not very thankful to have such a fine place to live at?

367-367	It is not my house, sir; and Abbot says I have less right to be here than a servant.

368-369	Pooh! you can't be silly enough to wish to leave such a splendid place?

370-370	If I had anywhere else to go, I should be glad to leave it; but I can never get away from Gateshead till I am a woman.

371-373	Perhaps you may--who knows?  Have you any relations besides Mrs. Reed?

374-374	I think not, sir.

375-375	None belonging to your father?

376-377	I don't know.  I asked Aunt Reed once, and she said possibly I might have some poor, low relations called Eyre, but she knew nothing about them.

378-378	If you had such, would you like to go to them?

2-2	No; I should not like to belong to poor people,

382-382	Not even if they were kind to you?

384-385	But are your relatives so very poor?  Are they working people?

386-386	I cannot tell; Aunt Reed says if I have any, they must be a beggarly set: I should not like to go a begging.

387-387	Would you like to go to school?

2-2	I should indeed like to go to school,

392-393	Well, well! who knows what may happen?

395-395	The child ought to have change of air and scene,

396-396	nerves not in a good state.

398-398	Is that your mistress, nurse?

401-401	I should like to speak to her before I go.

404-404	Missis was, she dared say, glad enough to get rid of such a tiresome, ill-conditioned child, who always looked as if she were watching everybody, and scheming plots underhand.

407-407	Poor Miss Jane is to be pitied, too, Abbot.

2-2	Yes,

408-408	if she were a nice, pretty child, one might compassionate her forlornness; but one really cannot care for such a little toad as that.

2-2	Not a great deal, to be sure,

409-409	at any rate, a beauty like Miss Georgiana would be more moving in the same condition.

410-410	Yes, I doat on Miss Georgiana!

412-414	Little darling!--with her long curls and her blue eyes, and such a sweet colour as she has; just as if she were painted!--Bessie, I could fancy a Welsh rabbit for supper.

415-416	So could I--with a roast onion.  Come, we'll go down.

425-425	that nasty Jane Eyre

426-426	Don't talk to me about her, John: I told you not to go near her; she is not worthy of notice; I do not choose that either you or your sisters should associate with her.

427-427	They are not fit to associate with me.

430-430	What would Uncle Reed say to you, if he were alive?

433-433	What?

437-437	My Uncle Reed is in heaven, and can see all you do and think; and so can papa and mama: they know how you shut me up all day long, and how you wish me dead.

453-453	Good night, Miss Jane.

471-472	Miss Jane, take off your pinafore; what are you doing there?  Have you washed your hands and face this morning?

473-473	No, Bessie; I have only just finished dusting.

474-476	Troublesome, careless child! and what are you doing now?  You look quite red, as if you had been about some mischief: what were you opening the window for?

486-486	Who could want me?

488-489	What should I see besides Aunt Reed in the apartment?--a man or a woman?

493-493	This is the little girl respecting whom I applied to you.

494-494	Her size is small: what is her age?

495-495	Ten years.

496-496	So much?

498-498	Your name, little girl?

499-499	Jane Eyre, sir.

501-501	Well, Jane Eyre, and are you a good child?

504-505	Perhaps the less said on that subject the better, Mr. Brocklehurst.

506-506	Sorry indeed to hear it! she and I must have some talk;

508-508	Come here,

2-2	No sight so sad as that of a naughty child,

515-516	especially a naughty little girl.  Do you know where the wicked go after death?

2-2	They go to hell,

518-519	And what is hell?  Can you tell me that?

520-520	A pit full of fire.

521-521	And should you like to fall into that pit, and to be burning there for ever?

522-522	No, sir.

523-523	What must you do to avoid it?

524-524	I must keep in good health, and not die.

525-528	How can you keep in good health?  Children younger than you die daily.  I buried a little child of five years old only a day or two since,--a good little child, whose soul is now in heaven.  It is to be feared the same could not be said of you were you to be called hence.

530-530	I hope that sigh is from the heart, and that you repent of ever having been the occasion of discomfort to your excellent benefactress.

531-532	Benefactress! benefactress!

533-534	they all call Mrs. Reed my benefactress; if so, a benefactress is a disagreeable thing.

535-535	Do you say your prayers night and morning?

537-537	Yes, sir.

538-538	Do you read your Bible?

539-539	Sometimes.

540-541	With pleasure?  Are you fond of it?

542-542	I like Revelations, and the book of Daniel, and Genesis and Samuel, and a little bit of Exodus, and some parts of Kings and Chronicles, and Job and Jonah.

543-544	And the Psalms?  I hope you like them?

545-545	No, sir.

546-550	No? oh, shocking!  I have a little boy, younger than you, who knows six Psalms by heart: and when you ask him which he would rather have, a gingerbread-nut to eat or a verse of a Psalm to learn, he says: 'Oh! the verse of a Psalm! angels sing Psalms;' says he, 'I wish to be a little angel here below;' he then gets two nuts in recompense for his infant piety.

2-2	Psalms are not interesting,

552-552	That proves you have a wicked heart; and you must pray to God to change it: to give you a new and clean one: to take away your heart of stone and give you a heart of flesh.

555-558	Mr. Brocklehurst, I believe I intimated in the letter which I wrote to you three weeks ago, that this little girl has not quite the character and disposition I could wish: should you admit her into Lowood school, I should be glad if the superintendent and teachers were requested to keep a strict eye on her, and, above all, to guard against her worst fault, a tendency to deceit.  I mention this in your hearing, Jane, that you may not attempt to impose on Mr. Brocklehurst.

2-2	Nothing, indeed,

2-2	Deceit is, indeed, a sad fault in a child,

565-567	it is akin to falsehood, and all liars will have their portion in the lake burning with fire and brimstone; she shall, however, be watched, Mrs. Reed.  I will speak to Miss Temple and the teachers.

2-2	I should wish her to be brought up in a manner suiting her prospects,

568-568	to be made useful, to be kept humble: as for the vacations, she will, with your permission, spend them always at Lowood.

2-2	Your decisions are perfectly judicious, madam,

571-574	Humility is a Christian grace, and one peculiarly appropriate to the pupils of Lowood; I, therefore, direct that especial care shall be bestowed on its cultivation amongst them.  I have studied how best to mortify in them the worldly sentiment of pride; and, only the other day, I had a pleasing proof of my success.  My second daughter, Augusta, went with her mama to visit the school, and on her return she exclaimed: 'Oh, dear papa, how quiet and plain all the girls at Lowood look, with their hair combed behind their ears, and their long pinafores, and those little holland pockets outside their frocks--they are almost like poor people's children! and,' said she, 'they looked at my dress and mama's, as if they had never seen a silk gown before.'

2-2	This is the state of things I quite approve,

576-578	had I sought all England over, I could scarcely have found a system more exactly fitting a child like Jane Eyre.  Consistency, my dear Mr. Brocklehurst; I advocate consistency in all things.

579-579	Consistency, madam, is the first of Christian duties; and it has been observed in every arrangement connected with the establishment of Lowood: plain fare, simple attire, unsophisticated accommodations, hardy and active habits; such is the order of the day in the house and its inhabitants.

580-581	Quite right, sir.  I may then depend upon this child being received as a pupil at Lowood, and there being trained in conformity to her position and prospects?

582-582	Madam, you may: she shall be placed in that nursery of chosen plants, and I trust she will show herself grateful for the inestimable privilege of her election.

583-584	I will send her, then, as soon as possible, Mr. Brocklehurst; for, I assure you, I feel anxious to be relieved of a responsibility that was becoming too irksome.

585-588	No doubt, no doubt, madam; and now I wish you good morning.  I shall return to Brocklehurst Hall in the course of a week or two: my good friend, the Archdeacon, will not permit me to leave him sooner.  I shall send Miss Temple notice that she is to expect a new girl, so that there will be no difficulty about receiving her.  Good-bye.

589-591	Good-bye, Mr. Brocklehurst; remember me to Mrs. and Miss Brocklehurst, and to Augusta and Theodore, and Master Broughton Brocklehurst.

592-593	I will, madam.  Little girl, here is a book entitled the 'Child's Guide,' read it with prayer, especially that part containing 'An account of the awfully sudden death of Martha G---, a naughty child addicted to falsehood and deceit.'

2-2	Go out of the room; return to the nursery,

612-612	I am not deceitful: if I were, I should say I loved you; but I declare I do not love you: I dislike you the worst of anybody in the world except John Reed; and this book about the liar, you may give to your girl, Georgiana, for it is she who tells lies, and not I.

615-615	What more have you to say?

618-619	I am glad you are no relation of mine: I will never call you aunt again as long as I live.  I will never come to see you when I am grown up; and if any one asks me how I liked you, and how you treated me, I will say the very thought of you makes me sick, and that you treated me with miserable cruelty.

620-620	How dare you affirm that, Jane Eyre?

621-631	How dare I, Mrs. Reed?  How dare I?  Because it is the _truth_.  You think I have no feelings, and that I can do without one bit of love or kindness; but I cannot live so: and you have no pity.  I shall remember how you thrust me back--roughly and violently thrust me back--into the red-room, and locked me up there, to my dying day; though I was in agony; though I cried out, while suffocating with distress, 'Have mercy!  Have mercy, Aunt Reed!'  And that punishment you made me suffer because your wicked boy struck me--knocked me down for nothing.  I will tell anybody who asks me questions, this exact tale.  People think you a good woman, but you are bad, hard-hearted.  _You_ are deceitful!

640-642	Jane, you are under a mistake: what is the matter with you?  Why do you tremble so violently?  Would you like to drink some water?

643-644	No, Mrs. Reed.

645-646	Is there anything else you wish for, Jane?  I assure you, I desire to be your friend.

647-649	Not you.  You told Mr. Brocklehurst I had a bad character, a deceitful disposition; and I'll let everybody at Lowood know what you are, and what you have done.

650-650	Jane, you don't understand these things: children must be corrected for their faults.

651-651	Deceit is not my fault!

653-653	But you are passionate, Jane, that you must allow: and now return to the nursery--there's a dear--and lie down a little.

654-655	I am not your dear; I cannot lie down: send me to school soon, Mrs. Reed, for I hate to live here.

2-2	I will indeed send her to school soon,

669-669	onding on snaw,

675-676	What shall I do?--what shall I do?

677-679	Miss Jane! where are you?  Come to lunch!

681-681	You naughty little thing!

683-683	Why don't you come when you are called?

687-688	Come, Bessie! don't scold.

2-2	You are a strange child, Miss Jane,

690-690	a little roving, solitary thing: and you are going to school, I suppose?

692-692	And won't you be sorry to leave poor Bessie?

693-694	What does Bessie care for me?  She is always scolding me.

695-696	Because you're such a queer, frightened, shy little thing.  You should be bolder.

697-698	What! to get more knocks?

699-702	Nonsense!  But you are rather put upon, that's certain.  My mother said, when she came to see me last week, that she would not like a little one of her own to be in your place.--Now, come in, and I've some good news for you.

703-703	I don't think you have, Bessie.

704-709	Child! what do you mean?  What sorrowful eyes you fix on me!  Well, but Missis and the young ladies and Master John are going out to tea this afternoon, and you shall have tea with me.  I'll ask cook to bake you a little cake, and then you shall help me to look over your drawers; for I am soon to pack your trunk.  Missis intends you to leave Gateshead in a day or two, and you shall choose what toys you like to take with you.

710-710	Bessie, you must promise not to scold me any more till I go.

711-712	Well, I will; but mind you are a very good girl, and don't be afraid of me.  Don't start when I chance to speak rather sharply; it's so provoking.

713-713	I don't think I shall ever be afraid of you again, Bessie, because I have got used to you, and I shall soon have another set of people to dread.

714-714	If you dread them they'll dislike you.

715-715	As you do, Bessie?

716-716	I don't dislike you, Miss; I believe I am fonder of you than of all the others.

717-717	You don't show it.

718-720	You little sharp thing! you've got quite a new way of talking.  What makes you so venturesome and hardy?

2-2	Why, I shall soon be away from you, and besides

723-723	And so you're glad to leave me?

724-724	Not at all, Bessie; indeed, just now I'm rather sorry.

725-728	Just now! and rather!  How coolly my little lady says it!  I dare say now if I were to ask you for a kiss you wouldn't give it me: you'd say you'd _rather_ not.

729-729	I'll kiss you and welcome: bend your head down.

741-741	Will you go in and bid Missis good- bye?

742-742	No, Bessie: she came to my crib last night when you were gone down to supper, and said I need not disturb her in the morning, or my cousins either; and she told me to remember that she had always been my best friend, and to speak of her and be grateful to her accordingly.

743-743	What did you say, Miss?

744-744	Nothing: I covered my face with the bedclothes, and turned from her to the wall.

745-745	That was wrong, Miss Jane.

746-747	It was quite right, Bessie.  Your Missis has not been my friend: she has been my foe.

748-749	O Miss Jane! don't say so!

750-750	Good-bye to Gateshead!

756-756	Is she going by herself?

758-758	Yes.

759-759	And how far is it?

760-760	Fifty miles.

761-763	What a long way!  I wonder Mrs. Reed is not afraid to trust her so far alone.

2-2	Be sure and take good care of her,

766-766	Ay, ay!

768-768	All right,

770-770	stony street

776-776	Is there a little girl called Jane Eyre here?

778-778	Yes,

2-2	The child is very young to be sent alone,

786-786	She had better be put to bed soon; she looks tired: are you tired?

788-788	A little, ma'am.

789-790	And hungry too, no doubt: let her have some supper before she goes to bed, Miss Miller.  Is this the first time you have left your parents to come to school, my little girl?

792-792	She hoped I should be a good child,

798-798	Monitors, collect the lesson-books and put them away!

800-800	Monitors, fetch the supper-trays!

811-811	Form classes!

812-812	Silence!

813-813	Order!

823-824	Disgusting!  The porridge is burnt again!

825-825	Silence!

833-834	Abominable stuff!  How shameful!

842-843	Silence!  To your seats!

854-854	Monitor of the first class, fetch the globes!

2-2	I have a word to address to the pupils,

864-864	You had this morning a breakfast which you could not eat; you must be hungry:--I have ordered that a lunch of bread and cheese shall be served to all.

2-2	It is to be done on my responsibility,

868-868	To the garden!

879-882	Lowood Institution.--This portion was rebuilt A.D. ---, by Naomi Brocklehurst, of Brocklehurst Hall, in this county.

883-883	Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.

889-889	Institution,

890-890	Rasselas;

891-891	Is your book interesting?

2-2	I like it,

894-894	What is it about?

2-2	You may look at it,

2-2	Rasselas

899-900	Can you tell me what the writing on that stone over the door means?  What is Lowood Institution?

901-901	This house where you are come to live.

902-903	And why do they call it Institution?  Is it in any way different from other schools?

904-905	It is partly a charity-school: you and I, and all the rest of us, are charity-children.  I suppose you are an orphan: are not either your father or your mother dead?

906-906	Both died before I can remember.

907-907	Well, all the girls here have lost either one or both parents, and this is called an institution for educating orphans.

908-909	Do we pay no money?  Do they keep us for nothing?

910-910	We pay, or our friends pay, fifteen pounds a year for each.

911-911	Then why do they call us charity-children?

912-912	Because fifteen pounds is not enough for board and teaching, and the deficiency is supplied by subscription.

913-913	Who subscribes?

914-914	Different benevolent-minded ladies and gentlemen in this neighbourhood and in London.

915-915	Who was Naomi Brocklehurst?

916-916	The lady who built the new part of this house as that tablet records, and whose son overlooks and directs everything here.

917-917	Why?

918-918	Because he is treasurer and manager of the establishment.

919-919	Then this house does not belong to that tall lady who wears a watch, and who said we were to have some bread and cheese?

920-925	To Miss Temple?  Oh, no!  I wish it did: she has to answer to Mr. Brocklehurst for all she does.  Mr. Brocklehurst buys all our food and all our clothes.

926-926	Does he live here?

927-927	No--two miles off, at a large hall.

928-928	Is he a good man?

929-929	He is a clergyman, and is said to do a great deal of good.

930-930	Did you say that tall lady was called Miss Temple?

931-931	Yes.

932-932	And what are the other teachers called?

933-933	The one with red cheeks is called Miss Smith; she attends to the work, and cuts out--for we make our own clothes, our frocks, and pelisses, and everything; the little one with black hair is Miss Scatcherd; she teaches history and grammar, and hears the second class repetitions; and the one who wears a shawl, and has a pocket-handkerchief tied to her side with a yellow ribband, is Madame Pierrot: she comes from Lisle, in France, and teaches French.

934-934	Do you like the teachers?

935-935	Well enough.

936-937	Do you like the little black one, and the Madame ---?--I cannot pronounce her name as you do.

938-938	Miss Scatcherd is hasty--you must take care not to offend her; Madame Pierrot is not a bad sort of person.

939-939	But Miss Temple is the best--isn't she?

940-940	Miss Temple is very good and very clever; she is above the rest, because she knows far more than they do.

941-941	Have you been long here?

942-942	Two years.

943-943	Are you an orphan?

944-944	My mother is dead.

945-945	Are you happy here?

946-947	You ask rather too many questions.  I have given you answers enough for the present: now I want to read.

957-957	How can she bear it so quietly--so firmly?

959-963	Were I in her place, it seems to me I should wish the earth to open and swallow me up.  She looks as if she were thinking of something beyond her punishment--beyond her situation: of something not round her nor before her.  I have heard of day-dreams--is she in a day-dream now?  Her eyes are fixed on the floor, but I am sure they do not see it--her sight seems turned in, gone down into her heart: she is looking at what she can remember, I believe; not at what is really present.  I wonder what sort of a girl she is--whether good or naughty.

2-2	Burns

981-981	Burns, you are standing on the side of your shoe; turn your toes out immediately.

982-982	Burns, you poke your chin most unpleasantly; draw it in.

984-984	Burns, I insist on your holding your head up; I will not have you before me in that attitude,

988-989	You dirty, disagreeable girl! you have never cleaned your nails this morning!

991-991	Why,

991-991	does she not explain that she could neither clean her nails nor wash her face, as the water was frozen?

997-997	Hardened girl!

998-998	nothing can correct you of your slatternly habits: carry the rod away.

1005-1005	Is it still 'Rasselas'?

2-2	Yes,

1007-1007	and I have just finished it.

1009-1009	Now,

1010-1010	I can perhaps get her to talk.

1012-1012	What is your name besides Burns?

1013-1013	Helen.

1014-1014	Do you come a long way from here?

1015-1015	I come from a place farther north, quite on the borders of Scotland.

1016-1016	Will you ever go back?

1017-1017	I hope so; but nobody can be sure of the future.

1018-1018	You must wish to leave Lowood?

1019-1021	No! why should I?  I was sent to Lowood to get an education; and it would be of no use going away until I have attained that object.

1022-1022	But that teacher, Miss Scatcherd, is so cruel to you?

1023-1025	Cruel?  Not at all!  She is severe: she dislikes my faults.

1026-1027	And if I were in your place I should dislike her; I should resist her. If she struck me with that rod, I should get it from her hand; I should break it under her nose.

1028-1030	Probably you would do nothing of the sort: but if you did, Mr. Brocklehurst would expel you from the school; that would be a great grief to your relations.  It is far better to endure patiently a smart which nobody feels but yourself, than to commit a hasty action whose evil consequences will extend to all connected with you; and besides, the Bible bids us return good for evil.

1031-1031	But then it seems disgraceful to be flogged, and to be sent to stand in the middle of a room full of people; and you are such a great girl: I am far younger than you, and I could not bear it.

1032-1032	Yet it would be your duty to bear it, if you could not avoid it: it is weak and silly to say you _cannot bear_ what it is your fate to be required to bear.

1036-1037	You say you have faults, Helen: what are they?  To me you seem very good.

1038-1039	Then learn from me, not to judge by appearances: I am, as Miss Scatcherd said, slatternly; I seldom put, and never keep, things, in order; I am careless; I forget rules; I read when I should learn my lessons; I have no method; and sometimes I say, like you, I cannot _bear_ to be subjected to systematic arrangements.  This is all very provoking to Miss Scatcherd, who is naturally neat, punctual, and particular.

2-2	And cross and cruel,

1041-1041	Is Miss Temple as severe to you as Miss Scatcherd?

1043-1044	Miss Temple is full of goodness; it pains her to be severe to any one, even the worst in the school: she sees my errors, and tells me of them gently; and, if I do anything worthy of praise, she gives me my meed liberally.  One strong proof of my wretchedly defective nature is, that even her expostulations, so mild, so rational, have not influence to cure me of my faults; and even her praise, though I value it most highly, cannot stimulate me to continued care and foresight.

2-2	That is curious,

1045-1045	it is so easy to be careful.

1046-1049	For _you_ I have no doubt it is.  I observed you in your class this morning, and saw you were closely attentive: your thoughts never seemed to wander while Miss Miller explained the lesson and questioned you.  Now, mine continually rove away; when I should be listening to Miss Scatcherd, and collecting all she says with assiduity, often I lose the very sound of her voice; I fall into a sort of dream.  Sometimes I think I am in Northumberland, and that the noises I hear round me are the bubbling of a little brook which runs through Deepden, near our house;--then, when it comes to my turn to reply, I have to be awakened; and having heard nothing of what was read for listening to the visionary brook, I have no answer ready.

1050-1050	Yet how well you replied this afternoon.

1051-1056	It was mere chance; the subject on which we had been reading had interested me.  This afternoon, instead of dreaming of Deepden, I was wondering how a man who wished to do right could act so unjustly and unwisely as Charles the First sometimes did; and I thought what a pity it was that, with his integrity and conscientiousness, he could see no farther than the prerogatives of the crown.  If he had but been able to look to a distance, and see how what they call the spirit of the age was tending!  Still, I like Charles--I respect him--I pity him, poor murdered king!  Yes, his enemies were the worst: they shed blood they had no right to shed.  How dared they kill him!

1059-1059	And when Miss Temple teaches you, do your thoughts wander then?

1060-1060	No, certainly, not often; because Miss Temple has generally something to say which is newer than my own reflections; her language is singularly agreeable to me, and the information she communicates is often just what I wished to gain.

1061-1061	Well, then, with Miss Temple you are good?

1062-1063	Yes, in a passive way: I make no effort; I follow as inclination guides me.  There is no merit in such goodness.

1064-1067	A great deal: you are good to those who are good to you.  It is all I ever desire to be.  If people were always kind and obedient to those who are cruel and unjust, the wicked people would have it all their own way: they would never feel afraid, and so they would never alter, but would grow worse and worse.  When we are struck at without a reason, we should strike back again very hard; I am sure we should--so hard as to teach the person who struck us never to do it again.

1068-1068	You will change your mind, I hope, when you grow older: as yet you are but a little untaught girl.

1069-1070	But I feel this, Helen; I must dislike those who, whatever I do to please them, persist in disliking me; I must resist those who punish me unjustly.  It is as natural as that I should love those who show me affection, or submit to punishment when I feel it is deserved.

1071-1071	Heathens and savage tribes hold that doctrine, but Christians and civilised nations disown it.

1072-1073	How?  I don't understand.

1074-1074	It is not violence that best overcomes hate--nor vengeance that most certainly heals injury.

1075-1075	What then?

1076-1076	Read the New Testament, and observe what Christ says, and how He acts; make His word your rule, and His conduct your example.

1077-1077	What does He say?

1078-1078	Love your enemies; bless them that curse you; do good to them that hate you and despitefully use you.

1079-1080	Then I should love Mrs. Reed, which I cannot do; I should bless her son John, which is impossible.

2-2	Well,

1084-1085	is not Mrs. Reed a hard-hearted, bad woman?

1086-1094	She has been unkind to you, no doubt; because you see, she dislikes your cast of character, as Miss Scatcherd does mine; but how minutely you remember all she has done and said to you!  What a singularly deep impression her injustice seems to have made on your heart!  No ill-usage so brands its record on my feelings.  Would you not be happier if you tried to forget her severity, together with the passionate emotions it excited?  Life appears to me too short to be spent in nursing animosity or registering wrongs.  We are, and must be, one and all, burdened with faults in this world: but the time will soon come when, I trust, we shall put them off in putting off our corruptible bodies; when debasement and sin will fall from us with this cumbrous frame of flesh, and only the spark of the spirit will remain,--the impalpable principle of light and thought, pure as when it left the Creator to inspire the creature: whence it came it will return; perhaps again to be communicated to some being higher than man--perhaps to pass through gradations of glory, from the pale human soul to brighten to the seraph!  Surely it will never, on the contrary, be suffered to degenerate from man to fiend?  No; I cannot believe that: I hold another creed: which no one ever taught me, and which I seldom mention; but in which I delight, and to which I cling: for it extends hope to all: it makes Eternity a rest--a mighty home, not a terror and an abyss.  Besides, with this creed, I can so clearly distinguish between the criminal and his crime; I can so sincerely forgive the first while I abhor the last: with this creed revenge never worries my heart, degradation never too deeply disgusts me, injustice never crushes me too low: I live in calm, looking to the end.

1097-1097	Helen Burns, if you don't go and put your drawer in order, and fold up your work this minute, I'll tell Miss Scatcherd to come and look at it!

1111-1111	like stalwart soldiers.

1131-1131	Coming Man,

1137-1141	I suppose, Miss Temple, the thread I bought at Lowton will do; it struck me that it would be just of the quality for the calico chemises, and I sorted the needles to match.  You may tell Miss Smith that I forgot to make a memorandum of the darning needles, but she shall have some papers sent in next week; and she is not, on any account, to give out more than one at a time to each pupil: if they have more, they are apt to be careless and lose them.  And, O ma'am!  I wish the woollen stockings were better looked to!--when I was here last, I went into the kitchen-garden and examined the clothes drying on the line; there was a quantity of black hose in a very bad state of repair: from the size of the holes in them I was sure they had not been well mended from time to time.

2-2	Your directions shall be attended to, sir,

2-2	And, ma'am,

1144-1144	the laundress tells me some of the girls have two clean tuckers in the week: it is too much; the rules limit them to one.

1145-1146	I think I can explain that circumstance, sir.  Agnes and Catherine Johnstone were invited to take tea with some friends at Lowton last Thursday, and I gave them leave to put on clean tuckers for the occasion.

1149-1154	Well, for once it may pass; but please not to let the circumstance occur too often.  And there is another thing which surprised me; I find, in settling accounts with the housekeeper, that a lunch, consisting of bread and cheese, has twice been served out to the girls during the past fortnight.  How is this?  I looked over the regulations, and I find no such meal as lunch mentioned.  Who introduced this innovation? and by what authority?

2-2	I must be responsible for the circumstance, sir,

1155-1155	the breakfast was so ill prepared that the pupils could not possibly eat it; and I dared not allow them to remain fasting till dinner-time.

1156-1158	Madam, allow me an instant.  You are aware that my plan in bringing up these girls is, not to accustom them to habits of luxury and indulgence, but to render them hardy, patient, self-denying.  Should any little accidental disappointment of the appetite occur, such as the spoiling of a meal, the under or the over dressing of a dish, the incident ought not to be neutralised by replacing with something more delicate the comfort lost, thus pampering the body and obviating the aim of this institution; it ought to be improved to the spiritual edification of the pupils, by encouraging them to evince fortitude under temporary privation.  A brief address on those occasions would not be mistimed, wherein a judicious instructor would take the opportunity of referring to the sufferings of the primitive Christians; to the torments of martyrs; to the exhortations of our blessed Lord Himself, calling upon His disciples to take up their cross and follow Him; to His warnings that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God; to His divine consolations, 

1160-1160	  Oh, madam, when you put bread and cheese, instead of burnt porridge, into these children's mouths, you may indeed feed their vile bodies, but you little think how you starve their immortal souls!

1166-1167	Miss Temple, Miss Temple, what--_what_ is that girl with curled hair? Red hair, ma'am, curled--curled all over?

2-2	It is Julia Severn,

1170-1172	Julia Severn, ma'am!  And why has she, or any other, curled hair?  Why, in defiance of every precept and principle of this house, does she conform to the world so openly--here in an evangelical, charitable establishment--as to wear her hair one mass of curls?

2-2	Julia's hair curls naturally,

1174-1178	Naturally!  Yes, but we are not to conform to nature; I wish these girls to be the children of Grace: and why that abundance?  I have again and again intimated that I desire the hair to be arranged closely, modestly, plainly.  Miss Temple, that girl's hair must be cut off entirely; I will send a barber to-morrow: and I see others who have far too much of the excrescence--that tall girl, tell her to turn round.  Tell all the first form to rise up and direct their faces to the wall.

1183-1183	All those top-knots must be cut off.

2-2	Madam,

4-4	I have a Master to serve whose kingdom is not of this world: my mission is to mortify in these girls the lusts of the flesh; to teach them to clothe themselves with shame-facedness and sobriety, not with braided hair and costly apparel; and each of the young persons before us has a string of hair twisted in plaits which vanity itself might have woven; these, I repeat, must be cut off; think of the time wasted, of--

1197-1197	A careless girl!

1199-1199	It is the new pupil, I perceive.

1200-1200	I must not forget I have a word to say respecting her.

1202-1202	Let the child who broke her slate come forward!

1203-1203	Don't be afraid, Jane, I saw it was an accident; you shall not be punished.

2-2	Another minute, and she will despise me for a hypocrite,

2-2	Fetch that stool,

1210-1210	Place the child upon it.

2-2	Ladies,

1215-1215	Miss Temple, teachers, and children, you all see this girl?

1217-1219	You see she is yet young; you observe she possesses the ordinary form of childhood; God has graciously given her the shape that He has given to all of us; no signal deformity points her out as a marked character.  Who would think that the Evil One had already found a servant and agent in her?  Yet such, I grieve to say, is the case.

2-2	My dear children,

1221-1223	this is a sad, a melancholy occasion; for it becomes my duty to warn you, that this girl, who might be one of God's own lambs, is a little castaway: not a member of the true flock, but evidently an interloper and an alien.  You must be on your guard against her; you must shun her example; if necessary, avoid her company, exclude her from your sports, and shut her out from your converse.  Teachers, you must watch her: keep your eyes on her movements, weigh well her words, scrutinise her actions, punish her body to save her soul: if, indeed, such salvation be possible, for (my tongue falters while I tell it) this girl, this child, the native of a Christian land, worse than many a little heathen who says its prayers to Brahma and kneels before Juggernaut--this girl is--a liar!

1224-1224	How shocking!

1227-1227	This I learned from her benefactress; from the pious and charitable lady who adopted her in her orphan state, reared her as her own daughter, and whose kindness, whose generosity the unhappy girl repaid by an ingratitude so bad, so dreadful, that at last her excellent patroness was obliged to separate her from her own young ones, fearful lest her vicious example should contaminate their purity: she has sent her here to be healed, even as the Jews of old sent their diseased to the troubled pool of Bethesda; and, teachers, superintendent, I beg of you not to allow the waters to stagnate round her.

1230-1230	Let her stand half-an-hour longer on that stool, and let no one speak to her during the remainder of the day.

1232-1232	the untidy badge;

2-2	Never,

2-2	Come, eat something,

1255-1255	Helen, why do you stay with a girl whom everybody believes to be a liar?

1256-1257	Everybody, Jane?  Why, there are only eighty people who have heard you called so, and the world contains hundreds of millions.

1258-1259	But what have I to do with millions?  The eighty, I know, despise me.

1260-1260	Jane, you are mistaken: probably not one in the school either despises or dislikes you: many, I am sure, pity you much.

1261-1262	How can they pity me after what Mr. Brocklehurst has said?

1263-1266	Mr. Brocklehurst is not a god: nor is he even a great and admired man: he is little liked here; he never took steps to make himself liked.  Had he treated you as an especial favourite, you would have found enemies, declared or covert, all around you; as it is, the greater number would offer you sympathy if they dared.  Teachers and pupils may look coldly on you for a day or two, but friendly feelings are concealed in their hearts; and if you persevere in doing well, these feelings will ere long appear so much the more evidently for their temporary suppression. Besides, Jane

1268-1268	Well, Helen?

1269-1269	If all the world hated you, and believed you wicked, while your own conscience approved you, and absolved you from guilt, you would not be without friends.

1270-1270	No; I know I should think well of myself; but that is not enough: if others don't love me I would rather die than live--I cannot bear to be solitary and hated, Helen.  Look here; to gain some real affection from you, or Miss Temple, or any other whom I truly love, I would willingly submit to have the bone of my arm broken, or to let a bull toss me, or to stand behind a kicking horse, and let it dash its hoof at my chest--

1271-1276	Hush, Jane! you think too much of the love of human beings; you are too impulsive, too vehement; the sovereign hand that created your frame, and put life into it, has provided you with other resources than your feeble self, or than creatures feeble as you.  Besides this earth, and besides the race of men, there is an invisible world and a kingdom of spirits: that world is round us, for it is everywhere; and those spirits watch us, for they are commissioned to guard us; and if we were dying in pain and shame, if scorn smote us on all sides, and hatred crushed us, angels see our tortures, recognise our innocence (if innocent we be: as I know you are of this charge which Mr. Brocklehurst has weakly and pompously repeated at second-hand from Mrs. Reed; for I read a sincere nature in your ardent eyes and on your clear front), and God waits only the separation of spirit from flesh to crown us with a full reward.  Why, then, should we ever sink overwhelmed with distress, when life is so soon over, and death is so certain an entrance to happiness--to glory?

2-2	I came on purpose to find you, Jane Eyre,

1282-1282	I want you in my room; and as Helen Burns is with you, she may come too.

1285-1285	Is it all over?

1287-1287	Have you cried your grief away?

1288-1288	I am afraid I never shall do that.

1289-1289	Why?

1290-1290	Because I have been wrongly accused; and you, ma'am, and everybody else, will now think me wicked.

1291-1292	We shall think you what you prove yourself to be, my child.  Continue to act as a good girl, and you will satisfy us.

1293-1293	Shall I, Miss Temple?

2-2	You will,

1295-1296	And now tell me who is the lady whom Mr. Brocklehurst called your benefactress?

1297-1299	Mrs. Reed, my uncle's wife.  My uncle is dead, and he left me to her care.

1300-1300	Did she not, then, adopt you of her own accord?

1301-1301	No, ma'am; she was sorry to have to do it: but my uncle, as I have often heard the servants say, got her to promise before he died that she would always keep me.

1302-1304	Well now, Jane, you know, or at least I will tell you, that when a criminal is accused, he is always allowed to speak in his own defence. You have been charged with falsehood; defend yourself to me as well as you can.  Say whatever your memory suggests is true; but add nothing and exaggerate nothing.

1311-1312	I know something of Mr. Lloyd; I shall write to him; if his reply agrees with your statement, you shall be publicly cleared from every imputation; to me, Jane, you are clear now.

1314-1315	How are you to-night, Helen?  Have you coughed much to-day?

1316-1316	Not quite so much, I think, ma'am.

1317-1317	And the pain in your chest?

1318-1318	It is a little better.

1320-1320	But you two are my visitors to-night; I must treat you as such.

2-2	Barbara,

1322-1322	I have not yet had tea; bring the tray and place cups for these two young ladies.

2-2	Barbara,

1327-1328	can you not bring a little more bread and butter? There is not enough for three.

1329-1330	Madam, Mrs. Harden says she has sent up the usual quantity.

1334-1334	Oh, very well!

1335-1335	we must make it do, Barbara, I suppose.

1336-1336	Fortunately, I have it in my power to supply deficiencies for this once.

2-2	I meant to give each of you some of this to take with you,

4-4	but as there is so little toast, you must have it now,

1351-1351	God bless you, my children!

2-2	My things were indeed in shameful disorder,

1354-1354	I intended to have arranged them, but I forgot.

2-2	Slattern,

1366-1366	Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.

1374-1374	ing

1415-1416	How sad to be lying now on a sick bed, and to be in danger of dying! This world is pleasant--it would be dreary to be called from it, and to have to go who knows where?

1421-1421	How is Helen Burns?

2-2	Very poorly,

1423-1424	Is it her Mr. Bates has been to see?

1425-1425	Yes.

1426-1426	And what does he say about her?

1427-1427	He says she'll not be here long.

2-2	She is in Miss Temple's room,

1433-1433	May I go up and speak to her?

1434-1435	Oh no, child!  It is not likely; and now it is time for you to come in; you'll catch the fever if you stop out when the dew is falling.

1451-1451	Helen!

1452-1452	are you awake?

1454-1454	Can it be you, Jane?

1456-1456	Oh!

1457-1457	she is not going to die; they are mistaken: she could not speak and look so calmly if she were.

1459-1460	Why are you come here, Jane?  It is past eleven o'clock: I heard it strike some minutes since.

1461-1461	I came to see you, Helen: I heard you were very ill, and I could not sleep till I had spoken to you.

1462-1462	You came to bid me good-bye, then: you are just in time probably.

1463-1464	Are you going somewhere, Helen?  Are you going home?

1465-1465	Yes; to my long home--my last home.

1466-1466	No, no, Helen!

1468-1468	Jane, your little feet are bare; lie down and cover yourself with my quilt.

1470-1474	I am very happy, Jane; and when you hear that I am dead, you must be sure and not grieve: there is nothing to grieve about.  We all must die one day, and the illness which is removing me is not painful; it is gentle and gradual: my mind is at rest.  I leave no one to regret me much: I have only a father; and he is lately married, and will not miss me.  By dying young, I shall escape great sufferings.  I had not qualities or talents to make my way very well in the world: I should have been continually at fault.

1475-1477	But where are you going to, Helen?  Can you see?  Do you know?

1478-1478	I believe; I have faith: I am going to God.

1479-1480	Where is God?  What is God?

1481-1482	My Maker and yours, who will never destroy what He created.  I rely implicitly on His power, and confide wholly in His goodness: I count the hours till that eventful one arrives which shall restore me to Him, reveal Him to me.

1483-1483	You are sure, then, Helen, that there is such a place as heaven, and that our souls can get to it when we die?

1484-1485	I am sure there is a future state; I believe God is good; I can resign my immortal part to Him without any misgiving.  God is my father; God is my friend: I love Him; I believe He loves me.

1486-1486	And shall I see you again, Helen, when I die?

1487-1487	You will come to the same region of happiness: be received by the same mighty, universal Parent, no doubt, dear Jane.

1489-1490	Where is that region?  Does it exist?

1492-1493	How comfortable I am!  That last fit of coughing has tired me a little; I feel as if I could sleep: but don't leave me, Jane; I like to have you near me.

1494-1494	I'll stay with you, _dear_ Helen: no one shall take me away.

1495-1495	Are you warm, darling?

1496-1496	Yes.

1497-1497	Good-night, Jane.

1498-1498	Good-night, Helen.

1503-1503	Resurgam.

1532-1532	Then,

1541-1541	grant me at least a new servitude!

1547-1547	A new servitude!  There is something in that,

1548-1554	I know there is, because it does not sound too sweet; it is not like such words as Liberty, Excitement, Enjoyment: delightful sounds truly; but no more than sounds for me; and so hollow and fleeting that it is mere waste of time to listen to them.  But Servitude!  That must be matter of fact.  Any one may serve: I have served here eight years; now all I want is to serve elsewhere.  Can I not get so much of my own will?  Is not the thing feasible?  Yes--yes--the end is not so difficult; if I had only a brain active enough to ferret out the means of attaining it.

1556-1560	What do I want?  A new place, in a new house, amongst new faces, under new circumstances: I want this because it is of no use wanting anything better.  How do people do to get a new place?  They apply to friends, I suppose: I have no friends.  There are many others who have no friends, who must look about for themselves and be their own helpers; and what is their resource?

1565-1565	Those who want situations advertise; you must advertise in the _---shire Herald_.

1566-1567	How?  I know nothing about advertising.

1568-1570	You must enclose the advertisement and the money to pay for it under a cover directed to the editor of the _Herald_; you must put it, the first opportunity you have, into the post at Lowton; answers must be addressed to J.E., at the post-office there; you can go and inquire in about a week after you send your letter, if any are come, and act accordingly.

2-2	A young lady accustomed to tuition

1573-1573	is desirous of meeting with a situation in a private family where the children are under fourteen (I thought that as I was barely eighteen, it would not do to undertake the guidance of pupils nearer my own age).  She is qualified to teach the usual branches of a good English education, together with French, Drawing, and Music

1575-1577	Address, J.E., Post-office, Lowton, --- shire.

1583-1585	Are there any letters for J.E.?

1590-1590	Is there only one?

2-2	There are no more,

1598-1602	If J.E., who advertised in the _---shire Herald_ of last Thursday, possesses the acquirements mentioned, and if she is in a position to give satisfactory references as to character and competency, a situation can be offered her where there is but one pupil, a little girl, under ten years of age; and where the salary is thirty pounds per annum.  J.E. is requested to send references, name, address, and all particulars to the direction:--

1603-1604	Mrs. Fairfax, Thornfield, near Millcote, ---shire.

1606-1606	but,

1616-1616	Thornfield will, probably, be a good way from the town.

1625-1625	I might do as I pleased: she had long relinquished all interference in my affairs.

2-2	Miss,

1636-1636	a person below wishes to see you.

2-2	The carrier, no doubt,

1638-1639	It's her, I am sure!--I could have told her anywhere!

1642-1642	Well, who is it?

1643-1643	you've not quite forgotten me, I think, Miss Jane?

1644-1646	Bessie! Bessie!  Bessie!

2-2	That is my little boy,

1650-1650	Then you are married, Bessie?

1651-1651	Yes; nearly five years since to Robert Leaven, the coachman; and I've a little girl besides Bobby there, that I've christened Jane.

1652-1652	And you don't live at Gateshead?

1653-1653	I live at the lodge: the old porter has left.

1654-1655	Well, and how do they all get on?  Tell me everything about them, Bessie: but sit down first; and, Bobby, come and sit on my knee, will you?

2-2	You're not grown so very tall, Miss Jane, nor so very stout,

1659-1659	I dare say they've not kept you too well at school: Miss Reed is the head and shoulders taller than you are; and Miss Georgiana would make two of you in breadth.

1660-1660	Georgiana is handsome, I suppose, Bessie?

1661-1663	Very.  She went up to London last winter with her mama, and there everybody admired her, and a young lord fell in love with her: but his relations were against the match; and--what do you think?--he and Miss Georgiana made it up to run away; but they were found out and stopped.  It was Miss Reed that found them out: I believe she was envious; and now she and her sister lead a cat and dog life together; they are always quarrelling--

1664-1664	Well, and what of John Reed?

1665-1666	Oh, he is not doing so well as his mama could wish.  He went to college, and he got--plucked, I think they call it: and then his uncles wanted him to be a barrister, and study the law: but he is such a dissipated young man, they will never make much of him, I think.

1667-1667	What does he look like?

1668-1668	He is very tall: some people call him a fine-looking young man; but he has such thick lips.

1669-1670	And Mrs. Reed?

1671-1672	Missis looks stout and well enough in the face, but I think she's not quite easy in her mind: Mr. John's conduct does not please her--he spends a deal of money.

1673-1673	Did she send you here, Bessie?

1674-1674	No, indeed: but I have long wanted to see you, and when I heard that there had been a letter from you, and that you were going to another part of the country, I thought I'd just set off, and get a look at you before you were quite out of my reach.

1675-1675	I am afraid you are disappointed in me, Bessie.

1677-1677	No, Miss Jane, not exactly: you are genteel enough; you look like a lady, and it is as much as ever I expected of you: you were no beauty as a child.

2-2	I dare say you are clever, though,

1680-1681	What can you do?  Can you play on the piano?

1682-1682	A little.

1684-1684	The Miss Reeds could not play as well!

1686-1686	I always said you would surpass them in learning: and can you draw?

1687-1687	That is one of my paintings over the chimney-piece.

1689-1690	Well, that is beautiful, Miss Jane!  It is as fine a picture as any Miss Reed's drawing-master could paint, let alone the young ladies themselves, who could not come near it: and have you learnt French?

1691-1691	Yes, Bessie, I can both read it and speak it.

1692-1692	And you can work on muslin and canvas?

1693-1693	I can.

1694-1697	Oh, you are quite a lady, Miss Jane!  I knew you would be: you will get on whether your relations notice you or not.  There was something I wanted to ask you.  Have you ever heard anything from your father's kinsfolk, the Eyres?

1698-1698	Never in my life.

1699-1701	Well, you know Missis always said they were poor and quite despicable: and they may be poor; but I believe they are as much gentry as the Reeds are; for one day, nearly seven years ago, a Mr. Eyre came to Gateshead and wanted to see you; Missis said you were at school fifty miles off; he seemed so much disappointed, for he could not stay: he was going on a voyage to a foreign country, and the ship was to sail from London in a day or two.  He looked quite a gentleman, and I believe he was your father's brother.

1702-1702	What foreign country was he going to, Bessie?

2-2	An island thousands of miles off, where they make wine--the butler did tell me--

1703-1703	Madeira?

1705-1705	Yes, that is it--that is the very word.

1706-1706	So he went?

1707-1708	Yes; he did not stay many minutes in the house: Missis was very high with him; she called him afterwards a 'sneaking tradesman.'  My Robert believes he was a wine-merchant.

2-2	Very likely,

1709-1709	or perhaps clerk or agent to a wine-merchant.

1717-1717	boots

1722-1722	Is there a place in this neighbourhood called Thornfield?

1724-1725	Thornfield?  I don't know, ma'am; I'll inquire at the bar.

1726-1726	Is your name Eyre, Miss?

1727-1727	Yes.

1728-1728	Person here waiting for you.

1730-1730	This will be your luggage, I suppose?

1732-1732	Yes.

1734-1734	A matter of six miles.

1735-1735	How long shall we be before we get there?

1736-1736	Happen an hour and a half.

2-2	I suppose,

1739-1748	judging from the plainness of the servant and carriage, Mrs. Fairfax is not a very dashing person: so much the better; I never lived amongst fine people but once, and I was very miserable with them.  I wonder if she lives alone except this little girl; if so, and if she is in any degree amiable, I shall surely be able to get on with her; I will do my best; it is a pity that doing one's best does not always answer.  At Lowood, indeed, I took that resolution, kept it, and succeeded in pleasing; but with Mrs. Reed, I remember my best was always spurned with scorn.  I pray God Mrs. Fairfax may not turn out a second Mrs. Reed; but if she does, I am not bound to stay with her! let the worst come to the worst, I can advertise again.  How far are we on our road now, I wonder?

1751-1751	You're noan so far fro' Thornfield now.

1756-1756	Will you walk this way, ma'am?

1762-1763	How do you do, my dear?  I am afraid you have had a tedious ride; John drives so slowly; you must be cold, come to the fire.

1764-1765	Mrs. Fairfax, I suppose?

1767-1767	Yes, you are right: do sit down.

1769-1770	Oh, it is no trouble; I dare say your own hands are almost numbed with cold.  Leah, make a little hot negus and cut a sandwich or two: here are the keys of the storeroom.

2-2	Now, then, draw nearer to the fire,

1773-1773	You've brought your luggage with you, haven't you, my dear?

1774-1774	Yes, ma'am.

2-2	I'll see it carried into your room,

2-2	She treats me like a visitor,

1777-1777	I little expected such a reception; I anticipated only coldness and stiffness: this is not like what I have heard of the treatment of governesses; but I must not exult too soon.

1780-1780	Shall I have the pleasure of seeing Miss Fairfax to-night?

1782-1782	What did you say, my dear?  I am a little deaf,

1785-1787	Miss Fairfax?  Oh, you mean Miss Varens!  Varens is the name of your future pupil.

1788-1789	Indeed!  Then she is not your daughter?

1790-1790	No,--I have no family.

2-2	I am so glad,

1792-1796	I am so glad you are come; it will be quite pleasant living here now with a companion.  To be sure it is pleasant at any time; for Thornfield is a fine old hall, rather neglected of late years perhaps, but still it is a respectable place; yet you know in winter-time one feels dreary quite alone in the best quarters.  I say alone--Leah is a nice girl to be sure, and John and his wife are very decent people; but then you see they are only servants, and one can't converse with them on terms of equality: one must keep them at due distance, for fear of losing one's authority.  I'm sure last winter (it was a very severe one, if you recollect, and when it did not snow, it rained and blew), not a creature but the butcher and postman came to the house, from November till February; and I really got quite melancholy with sitting night after night alone; I had Leah in to read to me sometimes; but I don't think the poor girl liked the task much: she felt it confining.  In spring and summer one got on better: sunshine and long days make such a difference; and then, just at the commencement of this autumn, little Adela Varens came and her nurse: a child makes a house alive all at once; and now you are here I shall be quite gay.

2-2	But I'll not keep you sitting up late to-night,

1798-1800	it is on the stroke of twelve now, and you have been travelling all day: you must feel tired.  If you have got your feet well warmed, I'll show you your bedroom.  I've had the room next to mine prepared for you; it is only a small apartment, but I thought you would like it better than one of the large front chambers: to be sure they have finer furniture, but they are so dreary and solitary, I never sleep in them myself.

1833-1834	What! out already?

1836-1836	I see you are an early riser.

1838-1838	How do you like Thornfield?

2-2	Yes,

1841-1842	it is a pretty place; but I fear it will be getting out of order, unless Mr. Rochester should take it into his head to come and reside here permanently; or, at least, visit it rather oftener: great houses and fine grounds require the presence of the proprietor.

1843-1844	Mr. Rochester!

1846-1846	Who is he?

2-2	The owner of Thornfield,

1848-1848	Did you not know he was called Rochester?

2-2	I thought,

1850-1850	Thornfield belonged to you.

1851-1857	To me?  Bless you, child; what an idea!  To me!  I am only the housekeeper--the manager.  To be sure I am distantly related to the Rochesters by the mother's side, or at least my husband was; he was a clergyman, incumbent of Hay--that little village yonder on the hill--and that church near the gates was his.  The present Mr. Rochester's mother was a Fairfax, and second cousin to my husband: but I never presume on the connection--in fact, it is nothing to me; I consider myself quite in the light of an ordinary housekeeper: my employer is always civil, and I expect nothing more.

1858-1858	And the little girl--my pupil!

1859-1862	She is Mr. Rochester's ward; he commissioned me to find a governess for her.  He intended to have her brought up in ---shire, I believe.  Here she comes, with her 'bonne,' as she calls her nurse.

2-2	Good morning, Miss Adela,

1870-1870	Come and speak to the lady who is to teach you, and to make you a clever woman some day.

1872-1872	C'est la ma gouverante!

1873-1873	Mais oui, certainement.

1874-1874	Are they foreigners?

1876-1877	The nurse is a foreigner, and Adela was born on the Continent; and, I believe, never left it till within six months ago.  When she first came here she could speak no English; now she can make shift to talk it a little: I don't understand her, she mixes it so with French; but you will make out her meaning very well, I dare say.

1880-1880	Ah!

1881-1890	you speak my language as well as Mr. Rochester does: I can talk to you as I can to him, and so can Sophie.  She will be glad: nobody here understands her: Madame Fairfax is all English. Sophie is my nurse; she came with me over the sea in a great ship with a chimney that smoked--how it did smoke!--and I was sick, and so was Sophie, and so was Mr. Rochester.  Mr. Rochester lay down on a sofa in a pretty room called the salon, and Sophie and I had little beds in another place.  I nearly fell out of mine; it was like a shelf.  And Mademoiselle--what is your name?

1891-1891	Eyre--Jane Eyre.

1892-1897	Aire?  Bah!  I cannot say it.  Well, our ship stopped in the morning, before it was quite daylight, at a great city--a huge city, with very dark houses and all smoky; not at all like the pretty clean town I came from; and Mr. Rochester carried me in his arms over a plank to the land, and Sophie came after, and we all got into a coach, which took us to a beautiful large house, larger than this and finer, called an hotel.  We stayed there nearly a week: I and Sophie used to walk every day in a great green place full of trees, called the Park; and there were many children there besides me, and a pond with beautiful birds in it, that I fed with crumbs.

1898-1898	Can you understand her when she runs on so fast?

2-2	I wish,

1902-1902	you would ask her a question or two about her parents: I wonder if she remembers them?

2-2	Adele,

1903-1903	with whom did you live when you were in that pretty clean town you spoke of?

1904-1907	I lived long ago with mama; but she is gone to the Holy Virgin.  Mama used to teach me to dance and sing, and to say verses.  A great many gentlemen and ladies came to see mama, and I used to dance before them, or to sit on their knees and sing to them: I liked it.  Shall I let you hear me sing now?

1913-1913	Now, Mademoiselle, I will repeat you some poetry.

1914-1914	La Ligue des Rats: fable de La Fontaine.

1916-1916	Was it your mama who taught you that piece?

1918-1921	Yes, and she just used to say it in this way: 'Qu' avez vous donc? lui dit un de ces rats; parlez!'  She made me lift my hand--so--to remind me to raise my voice at the question.  Now shall I dance for you?

1922-1922	No, that will do: but after your mama went to the Holy Virgin, as you say, with whom did you live then?

1923-1928	With Madame Frederic and her husband: she took care of me, but she is nothing related to me.  I think she is poor, for she had not so fine a house as mama.  I was not long there.  Mr. Rochester asked me if I would like to go and live with him in England, and I said yes; for I knew Mr. Rochester before I knew Madame Frederic, and he was always kind to me and gave me pretty dresses and toys: but you see he has not kept his word, for he has brought me to England, and now he is gone back again himself, and I never see him.

1938-1938	Your morning school-hours are over now, I suppose,

1943-1943	What a beautiful room!

1945-1946	Yes; this is the dining-room.  I have just opened the window, to let in a little air and sunshine; for everything gets so damp in apartments that are seldom inhabited; the drawing-room yonder feels like a vault.

1950-1951	In what order you keep these rooms, Mrs. Fairfax!

1953-1953	No dust, no canvas coverings: except that the air feels chilly, one would think they were inhabited daily.

1954-1955	Why, Miss Eyre, though Mr. Rochester's visits here are rare, they are always sudden and unexpected; and as I observed that it put him out to find everything swathed up, and to have a bustle of arrangement on his arrival, I thought it best to keep the rooms in readiness.

1956-1957	Is Mr. Rochester an exacting, fastidious sort of man?

1958-1958	Not particularly so; but he has a gentleman's tastes and habits, and he expects to have things managed in conformity to them.

1959-1960	Do you like him?  Is he generally liked?

1961-1962	Oh, yes; the family have always been respected here.  Almost all the land in this neighbourhood, as far as you can see, has belonged to the Rochesters time out of mind.

1963-1964	Well, but, leaving his land out of the question, do you like him?  Is he liked for himself?

1965-1965	I have no cause to do otherwise than like him; and I believe he is considered a just and liberal landlord by his tenants: but he has never lived much amongst them.

1966-1967	But has he no peculiarities?  What, in short, is his character?

1968-1971	Oh! his character is unimpeachable, I suppose.  He is rather peculiar, perhaps: he has travelled a great deal, and seen a great deal of the world, I should think.  I dare say he is clever, but I never had much conversation with him.

1972-1972	In what way is he peculiar?

1973-1973	I don't know--it is not easy to describe--nothing striking, but you feel it when he speaks to you; you cannot be always sure whether he is in jest or earnest, whether he is pleased or the contrary; you don't thoroughly understand him, in short--at least, I don't: but it is of no consequence, he is a very good master.

1985-1985	Do the servants sleep in these rooms?

1987-1987	No; they occupy a range of smaller apartments to the back; no one ever sleeps here: one would almost say that, if there were a ghost at Thornfield Hall, this would be its haunt.

1988-1988	So I think: you have no ghost, then?

2-2	None that I ever heard of,

1991-1992	Nor any traditions of one? no legends or ghost stories?

1993-1994	I believe not.  And yet it is said the Rochesters have been rather a violent than a quiet race in their time: perhaps, though, that is the reason they rest tranquilly in their graves now.

2-2	Yes--'after life's fitful fever they sleep well,'

1996-1997	Where are you going now, Mrs. Fairfax?

1999-1999	On to the leads; will you come and see the view from thence?

2012-2013	Mrs. Fairfax!

2015-2016	Did you hear that loud laugh?  Who is it?

2-2	Some of the servants, very likely,

2017-2017	perhaps Grace Poole.

2018-2018	Did you hear it?

2020-2021	Yes, plainly: I often hear her: she sews in one of these rooms. Sometimes Leah is with her; they are frequently noisy together.

2023-2023	Grace!

2-2	Too much noise, Grace,

2031-2031	Remember directions!

2-2	She is a person we have to sew and assist Leah in her housemaid's work,

2033-2034	not altogether unobjectionable in some points, but she does well enough.  By-the-bye, how have you got on with your new pupil this morning?

2036-2036	Mesdames, vous etes servies!

2037-2037	J'ai bien faim, moi!

2078-2078	Revenez bientot, ma bonne amie, ma chere Mdlle. Jeannette,

2095-2095	Gytrash,

2104-2104	What the deuce is to do now?

2110-2110	Are you injured, sir?

2112-2112	Can I do anything?

2-2	You must just stand on one side,

2116-2116	Down, Pilot!

2119-2119	If you are hurt, and want help, sir, I can fetch some one either from Thornfield Hall or from Hay.

2-2	Thank you: I shall do: I have no broken bones,--only a sprain;

2120-2120	Ugh!

2128-2128	I cannot think of leaving you, sir, at so late an hour, in this solitary lane, till I see you are fit to mount your horse.

2-2	I should think you ought to be at home yourself,

2130-2130	if you have a home in this neighbourhood: where do you come from?

2131-2131	From just below; and I am not at all afraid of being out late when it is moonlight: I will run over to Hay for you with pleasure, if you wish it: indeed, I am going there to post a letter.

2132-2132	You live just below--do you mean at that house with the battlements?

2134-2134	Yes, sir.

2135-2135	Whose house is it?

2136-2137	Mr. Rochester's.

2138-2139	Do you know Mr. Rochester?

2140-2140	No, I have never seen him.

2141-2141	He is not resident, then?

2142-2142	No.

2143-2143	Can you tell me where he is?

2144-2144	I cannot.

2145-2145	You are not a servant at the hall, of course.  You are--

2148-2148	I am the governess.

2149-2149	Ah, the governess!

2150-2151	deuce take me, if I had not forgotten! The governess!

2-2	I cannot commission you to fetch help,

2154-2154	but you may help me a little yourself, if you will be so kind.

2155-2155	Yes, sir.

2156-2156	You have not an umbrella that I can use as a stick?

2157-2157	No.

2158-2158	Try to get hold of my horse's bridle and lead him to me: you are not afraid?

2-2	I see,

2163-2163	the mountain will never be brought to Mahomet, so all you can do is to aid Mahomet to go to the mountain; I must beg of you to come here.

2165-2165	Excuse me,

2165-2165	necessity compels me to make you useful.

2-2	Now,

2168-2168	just hand me my whip; it lies there under the hedge.

2170-2170	Thank you; now make haste with the letter to Hay, and return as fast as you can.

2171-2171	Like heath that, in the wilderness,    The wild wind whirls away.

2179-2179	too easy chair

2189-2189	Pilot

2196-2196	What dog is this?

2197-2197	He came with master.

2198-2198	With whom?

2199-2200	With master--Mr. Rochester--he is just arrived.

2201-2203	Indeed! and is Mrs. Fairfax with him?

2204-2204	Yes, and Miss Adele; they are in the dining-room, and John is gone for a surgeon; for master has had an accident; his horse fell and his ankle is sprained.

2205-2205	Did the horse fall in Hay Lane?

2206-2206	Yes, coming down-hill; it slipped on some ice.

2207-2208	Ah!  Bring me a candle will you Leah?

2220-2220	ami, Monsieur Edouard Fairfax _de_ Rochester,

2-2	Et cela doit signifier,

2221-2223	qu'il y aura la dedans un cadeau pour moi, et peut-etre pour vous aussi, mademoiselle.  Monsieur a parle de vous: il m'a demande le nom de ma gouvernante, et si elle n'etait pas une petite personne, assez mince et un peu pale.  J'ai dit qu'oui: car c'est vrai, n'est-ce pas, mademoiselle?

2232-2232	Mr. Rochester would be glad if you and your pupil would take tea with him in the drawing-room this evening,

2233-2233	he has been so much engaged all day that he could not ask to see you before.

2234-2234	When is his tea-time?

2236-2238	Oh, at six o'clock: he keeps early hours in the country.  You had better change your frock now; I will go with you and fasten it.  Here is a candle.

2239-2239	Is it necessary to change my frock?

2240-2241	Yes, you had better: I always dress for the evening when Mr. Rochester is here.

2-2	You want a brooch,

2-2	Here is Miss Eyre, sir,

2-2	Let Miss Eyre be seated,

2263-2264	What the deuce is it to me whether Miss Eyre be there or not? At this moment I am not disposed to accost her.

2-2	Madam, I should like some tea,

2276-2277	Will you hand Mr. Rochester's cup?

2279-2279	Adele might perhaps spill it.

2281-2281	N'est-ce pas, monsieur, qu'il y a un cadeau pour Mademoiselle Eyre dans votre petit coffre?

2282-2282	Who talks of cadeaux?

2284-2285	Did you expect a present, Miss Eyre?  Are you fond of presents?

2287-2287	I hardly know, sir; I have little experience of them: they are generally thought pleasant things.

2288-2289	Generally thought?  But what do _you_ think?

2290-2291	I should be obliged to take time, sir, before I could give you an answer worthy of your acceptance: a present has many faces to it, has it not? and one should consider all, before pronouncing an opinion as to its nature.

2292-2292	Miss Eyre, you are not so unsophisticated as Adele: she demands a 'cadeau,' clamorously, the moment she sees me: you beat about the bush.

2293-2293	Because I have less confidence in my deserts than Adele has: she can prefer the claim of old acquaintance, and the right too of custom; for she says you have always been in the habit of giving her playthings; but if I had to make out a case I should be puzzled, since I am a stranger, and have done nothing to entitle me to an acknowledgment.

2294-2295	Oh, don't fall back on over-modesty!  I have examined Adele, and find you have taken great pains with her: she is not bright, she has no talents; yet in a short time she has made much improvement.

2296-2296	Sir, you have now given me my 'cadeau;' I am obliged to you: it is the meed teachers most covet--praise of their pupils' progress.

2297-2297	Humph!

2-2	Come to the fire,

2303-2303	You have been resident in my house three months?

2304-2304	Yes, sir.

2305-2305	And you came from--?

2306-2306	From Lowood school, in ---shire.

2307-2309	Ah! a charitable concern.  How long were you there?

2310-2310	Eight years.

2311-2317	Eight years! you must be tenacious of life.  I thought half the time in such a place would have done up any constitution!  No wonder you have rather the look of another world.  I marvelled where you had got that sort of face.  When you came on me in Hay Lane last night, I thought unaccountably of fairy tales, and had half a mind to demand whether you had bewitched my horse: I am not sure yet.  Who are your parents?

2318-2318	I have none.

2319-2319	Nor ever had, I suppose: do you remember them?

2320-2320	No.

2321-2322	I thought not.  And so you were waiting for your people when you sat on that stile?

2323-2323	For whom, sir?

2324-2325	For the men in green: it was a proper moonlight evening for them.  Did I break through one of your rings, that you spread that damned ice on the causeway?

2327-2327	The men in green all forsook England a hundred years ago,

2328-2329	And not even in Hay Lane, or the fields about it, could you find a trace of them.  I don't think either summer or harvest, or winter moon, will ever shine on their revels more.

2-2	Well,

2333-2333	if you disown parents, you must have some sort of kinsfolk: uncles and aunts?

2334-2334	No; none that I ever saw.

2335-2335	And your home?

2336-2336	I have none.

2337-2337	Where do your brothers and sisters live?

2338-2338	I have no brothers or sisters.

2339-2339	Who recommended you to come here?

2340-2341	I advertised, and Mrs. Fairfax answered my advertisement.

2-2	Yes,

2342-2343	and I am daily thankful for the choice Providence led me to make.  Miss Eyre has been an invaluable companion to me, and a kind and careful teacher to Adele.

2-2	Don't trouble yourself to give her a character,

2345-2346	eulogiums will not bias me; I shall judge for myself.  She began by felling my horse.

2347-2347	Sir?

2350-2350	I have to thank her for this sprain.

2352-2352	Miss Eyre, have you ever lived in a town?

2353-2353	No, sir.

2354-2354	Have you seen much society?

2355-2355	None but the pupils and teachers of Lowood, and now the inmates of Thornfield.

2356-2356	Have you read much?

2357-2357	Only such books as came in my way; and they have not been numerous or very learned.

2358-2358	You have lived the life of a nun: no doubt you are well drilled in religious forms;--Brocklehurst, who I understand directs Lowood, is a parson, is he not?

2359-2359	Yes, sir.

2360-2360	And you girls probably worshipped him, as a convent full of religieuses would worship their director.

2361-2361	Oh, no.

2362-2366	You are very cool!  No!  What! a novice not worship her priest!  That sounds blasphemous.

2367-2369	I disliked Mr. Brocklehurst; and I was not alone in the feeling.  He is a harsh man; at once pompous and meddling; he cut off our hair; and for economy's sake bought us bad needles and thread, with which we could hardly sew.

2-2	That was very false economy,

2372-2372	And was that the head and front of his offending?

2375-2375	He starved us when he had the sole superintendence of the provision department, before the committee was appointed; and he bored us with long lectures once a week, and with evening readings from books of his own inditing, about sudden deaths and judgments, which made us afraid to go to bed.

2376-2376	What age were you when you went to Lowood?

2377-2377	About ten.

2378-2378	And you stayed there eight years: you are now, then, eighteen?

2380-2383	Arithmetic, you see, is useful; without its aid, I should hardly have been able to guess your age.  It is a point difficult to fix where the features and countenance are so much at variance as in your case.  And now what did you learn at Lowood?  Can you play?

2384-2384	A little.

2385-2388	Of course: that is the established answer.  Go into the library--I mean, if you please.--(Excuse my tone of command; I am used to say, 'Do this,' and it is done: I cannot alter my customary habits for one new inmate.)--Go, then, into the library; take a candle with you; leave the door open; sit down to the piano, and play a tune.

2390-2390	Enough!

2392-2392	You play _a little_, I see; like any other English school-girl; perhaps rather better than some, but not well.

2395-2396	Adele showed me some sketches this morning, which she said were yours.  I don't know whether they were entirely of your doing; probably a master aided you?

2397-2397	No, indeed!

2399-2401	Ah! that pricks pride.  Well, fetch me your portfolio, if you can vouch for its contents being original; but don't pass your word unless you are certain: I can recognise patchwork.

2402-2402	Then I will say nothing, and you shall judge for yourself, sir.

2-2	Approach the table,

2-2	No crowding,

2408-2408	take the drawings from my hand as I finish with them; but don't push your faces up to mine.

2411-2411	Take them off to the other table, Mrs. Fairfax,

2413-2413	and look at them with Adele;--you

2412-2413	resume your seat, and answer my questions.  I perceive those pictures were done by one hand: was that hand yours?

2414-2414	Yes.

2415-2416	And when did you find time to do them?  They have taken much time, and some thought.

2417-2417	I did them in the last two vacations I spent at Lowood, when I had no other occupation.

2418-2418	Where did you get your copies?

2419-2419	Out of my head.

2420-2420	That head I see now on your shoulders?

2421-2421	Yes, sir.

2422-2422	Has it other furniture of the same kind within?

2423-2423	I should think it may have: I should hope--better.

2437-2437	the likeness of a kingly crown;

2440-2440	the shape which shape had none.

2441-2441	Were you happy when you painted these pictures?

2444-2445	I was absorbed, sir: yes, and I was happy.  To paint them, in short, was to enjoy one of the keenest pleasures I have ever known.

2446-2448	That is not saying much.  Your pleasures, by your own account, have been few; but I daresay you did exist in a kind of artist's dreamland while you blent and arranged these strange tints.  Did you sit at them long each day?

2449-2449	I had nothing else to do, because it was the vacation, and I sat at them from morning till noon, and from noon till night: the length of the midsummer days favoured my inclination to apply.

2450-2450	And you felt self-satisfied with the result of your ardent labours?

2451-2452	Far from it.  I was tormented by the contrast between my idea and my handiwork: in each case I had imagined something which I was quite powerless to realise.

2453-2465	Not quite: you have secured the shadow of your thought; but no more, probably.  You had not enough of the artist's skill and science to give it full being: yet the drawings are, for a school-girl, peculiar.  As to the thoughts, they are elfish.  These eyes in the Evening Star you must have seen in a dream.  How could you make them look so clear, and yet not at all brilliant? for the planet above quells their rays.  And what meaning is that in their solemn depth?  And who taught you to paint wind? There is a high gale in that sky, and on this hill-top.  Where did you see Latmos?  For that is Latmos.  There! put the drawings away!

2466-2467	It is nine o'clock: what are you about, Miss Eyre, to let Adele sit up so long?  Take her to bed.

2-2	I wish you all good-night, now,

2472-2473	You said Mr. Rochester was not strikingly peculiar, Mrs. Fairfax,

2475-2475	Well, is he?

2476-2476	I think so: he is very changeful and abrupt.

2477-2477	True: no doubt he may appear so to a stranger, but I am so accustomed to his manner, I never think of it; and then, if he has peculiarities of temper, allowance should be made.

2478-2478	Why?

2479-2479	Partly because it is his nature--and we can none of us help our nature; and partly because he has painful thoughts, no doubt, to harass him, and make his spirits unequal.

2480-2480	What about?

2481-2481	Family troubles, for one thing.

2482-2482	But he has no family.

2483-2484	Not now, but he has had--or, at least, relatives.  He lost his elder brother a few years since.

2485-2485	His _elder_ brother?

2486-2488	Yes.  The present Mr. Rochester has not been very long in possession of the property; only about nine years.

2489-2490	Nine years is a tolerable time.  Was he so very fond of his brother as to be still inconsolable for his loss?

2491-2504	Why, no--perhaps not.  I believe there were some misunderstandings between them.  Mr. Rowland Rochester was not quite just to Mr. Edward; and perhaps he prejudiced his father against him.  The old gentleman was fond of money, and anxious to keep the family estate together.  He did not like to diminish the property by division, and yet he was anxious that Mr. Edward should have wealth, too, to keep up the consequence of the name; and, soon after he was of age, some steps were taken that were not quite fair, and made a great deal of mischief.  Old Mr. Rochester and Mr. Rowland combined to bring Mr. Edward into what he considered a painful position, for the sake of making his fortune: what the precise nature of that position was I never clearly knew, but his spirit could not brook what he had to suffer in it.  He is not very forgiving: he broke with his family, and now for many years he has led an unsettled kind of life.  I don't think he has ever been resident at Thornfield for a fortnight together, since the death of his brother without a will left him master of the estate; and, indeed, no wonder he shuns the old place.

2505-2505	Why should he shun it?

2506-2506	Perhaps he thinks it gloomy.

2526-2527	Ma boite! ma boite!

2-2	Yes, there is your 'boite' at last: take it into a corner, you genuine daughter of Paris, and amuse yourself with disembowelling it,

2530-2530	And mind,

2531-2531	don't bother me with any details of the anatomical process, or any notice of the condition of the entrails: let your operation be conducted in silence: tiens-toi tranquille, enfant; comprends-tu?

2533-2534	Oh ciel!  Que c'est beau!

2536-2536	Is Miss Eyre there?

2538-2539	Ah! well, come forward; be seated here.

2541-2541	I am not fond of the prattle of children,

2541-2547	for, old bachelor as I am, I have no pleasant associations connected with their lisp.  It would be intolerable to me to pass a whole evening _tete-a-tete_ with a brat.  Don't draw that chair farther off, Miss Eyre; sit down exactly where I placed it--if you please, that is.  Confound these civilities!  I continually forget them.  Nor do I particularly affect simple-minded old ladies.  By-the-bye, I must have mine in mind; it won't do to neglect her; she is a Fairfax, or wed to one; and blood is said to be thicker than water.

2550-2551	Good evening, madam; I sent to you for a charitable purpose.  I have forbidden Adele to talk to me about her presents, and she is bursting with repletion: have the goodness to serve her as auditress and interlocutrice; it will be one of the most benevolent acts you ever performed.

2553-2553	boite;

2-2	Now I have performed the part of a good host,

2555-2556	put my guests into the way of amusing each other, I ought to be at liberty to attend to my own pleasure.  Miss Eyre, draw your chair still a little farther forward: you are yet too far back; I cannot see you without disturbing my position in this comfortable chair, which I have no mind to do.

2-2	You examine me, Miss Eyre,

2565-2565	do you think me handsome?

2566-2566	No, sir.

2567-2568	Ah!  By my word! there is something singular about you,

2569-2570	you have the air of a little _nonnette_; quaint, quiet, grave, and simple, as you sit with your hands before you, and your eyes generally bent on the carpet (except, by-the-bye, when they are directed piercingly to my face; as just now, for instance); and when one asks you a question, or makes a remark to which you are obliged to reply, you rap out a round rejoinder, which, if not blunt, is at least brusque.  What do you mean by it?

2571-2572	Sir, I was too plain; I beg your pardon.  I ought to have replied that it was not easy to give an impromptu answer to a question about appearances; that tastes mostly differ; and that beauty is of little consequence, or something of that sort.

2573-2577	You ought to have replied no such thing.  Beauty of little consequence, indeed!  And so, under pretence of softening the previous outrage, of stroking and soothing me into placidity, you stick a sly penknife under my ear!  Go on: what fault do you find with me, pray?  I suppose I have all my limbs and all my features like any other man?

2578-2579	Mr. Rochester, allow me to disown my first answer: I intended no pointed repartee: it was only a blunder.

2580-2581	Just so: I think so: and you shall be answerable for it.  Criticise me: does my forehead not please you?

2583-2583	Now, ma'am, am I a fool?

2584-2585	Far from it, sir.  You would, perhaps, think me rude if I inquired in return whether you are a philanthropist?

2586-2588	There again!  Another stick of the penknife, when she pretended to pat my head: and that is because I said I did not like the society of children and old women (low be it spoken!).  No, young lady, I am not a general philanthropist; but I bear a conscience;

2589-2591	and, besides, I once had a kind of rude tenderness of heart.  When I was as old as you, I was a feeling fellow enough, partial to the unfledged, unfostered, and unlucky; but Fortune has knocked me about since: she has even kneaded me with her knuckles, and now I flatter myself I am hard and tough as an India-rubber ball; pervious, though, through a chink or two still, and with one sentient point in the middle of the lump.  Yes: does that leave hope for me?

2592-2592	Hope of what, sir?

2593-2593	Of my final re-transformation from India-rubber back to flesh?

2-2	Decidedly he has had too much wine,

2595-2596	You looked very much puzzled, Miss Eyre; and though you are not pretty any more than I am handsome, yet a puzzled air becomes you; besides, it is convenient, for it keeps those searching eyes of yours away from my physiognomy, and busies them with the worsted flowers of the rug; so puzzle on.  Young lady, I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night.

2-2	I am disposed to be gregarious and communicative to-night,

2599-2603	and that is why I sent for you: the fire and the chandelier were not sufficient company for me; nor would Pilot have been, for none of these can talk.  Adele is a degree better, but still far below the mark; Mrs. Fairfax ditto; you, I am persuaded, can suit me if you will: you puzzled me the first evening I invited you down here.  I have almost forgotten you since: other ideas have driven yours from my head; but to-night I am resolved to be at ease; to dismiss what importunes, and recall what pleases.  It would please me now to draw you out--to learn more of you--therefore speak.

2-2	Speak,

2606-2606	What about, sir?

2607-2608	Whatever you like.  I leave both the choice of subject and the manner of treating it entirely to yourself.

2-2	If he expects me to talk for the mere sake of talking and showing off, he will find he has addressed himself to the wrong person,

2610-2610	You are dumb, Miss Eyre.

2613-2613	Stubborn?

2614-2618	and annoyed.  Ah! it is consistent.  I put my request in an absurd, almost insolent form.  Miss Eyre, I beg your pardon.  The fact is, once for all, I don't wish to treat you like an inferior: that is

2619-2620	I claim only such superiority as must result from twenty years' difference in age and a century's advance in experience.  This is legitimate, _et j'y tiens_, as Adele would say; and it is by virtue of this superiority, and this alone, that I desire you to have the goodness to talk to me a little now, and divert my thoughts, which are galled with dwelling on one point--cankering as a rusty nail.

2622-2623	I am willing to amuse you, if I can, sir--quite willing; but I cannot introduce a topic, because how do I know what will interest you?  Ask me questions, and I will do my best to answer them.

2624-2624	Then, in the first place, do you agree with me that I have a right to be a little masterful, abrupt, perhaps exacting, sometimes, on the grounds I stated, namely, that I am old enough to be your father, and that I have battled through a varied experience with many men of many nations, and roamed over half the globe, while you have lived quietly with one set of people in one house?

2625-2625	Do as you please, sir.

2626-2627	That is no answer; or rather it is a very irritating, because a very evasive one.  Reply clearly.

2628-2628	I don't think, sir, you have a right to command me, merely because you are older than I, or because you have seen more of the world than I have; your claim to superiority depends on the use you have made of your time and experience.

2629-2633	Humph!  Promptly spoken.  But I won't allow that, seeing that it would never suit my case, as I have made an indifferent, not to say a bad, use of both advantages.  Leaving superiority out of the question, then, you must still agree to receive my orders now and then, without being piqued or hurt by the tone of command.  Will you?

2-2	The smile is very well,

2636-2636	but speak too.

2637-2637	I was thinking, sir, that very few masters would trouble themselves to inquire whether or not their paid subordinates were piqued and hurt by their orders.

2638-2642	Paid subordinates!  What! you are my paid subordinate, are you?  Oh yes, I had forgotten the salary!  Well then, on that mercenary ground, will you agree to let me hector a little?

2643-2643	No, sir, not on that ground; but, on the ground that you did forget it, and that you care whether or not a dependent is comfortable in his dependency, I agree heartily.

2644-2644	And will you consent to dispense with a great many conventional forms and phrases, without thinking that the omission arises from insolence?

2645-2645	I am sure, sir, I should never mistake informality for insolence: one I rather like, the other nothing free-born would submit to, even for a salary.

2646-2651	Humbug!  Most things free-born will submit to anything for a salary; therefore, keep to yourself, and don't venture on generalities of which you are intensely ignorant.  However, I mentally shake hands with you for your answer, despite its inaccuracy; and as much for the manner in which it was said, as for the substance of the speech; the manner was frank and sincere; one does not often see such a manner: no, on the contrary, affectation, or coldness, or stupid, coarse-minded misapprehension of one's meaning are the usual rewards of candour.  Not three in three thousand raw school-girl-governesses would have answered me as you have just done.  But I don't mean to flatter you: if you are cast in a different mould to the majority, it is no merit of yours: Nature did it. And then, after all, I go too fast in my conclusions: for what I yet know, you may be no better than the rest; you may have intolerable defects to counterbalance your few good points.

2-2	And so may you,

2-2	Yes, yes, you are right,

2653-2657	I have plenty of faults of my own: I know it, and I don't wish to palliate them, I assure you.  God wot I need not be too severe about others; I have a past existence, a series of deeds, a colour of life to contemplate within my own breast, which might well call my sneers and censures from my neighbours to myself.  I started, or rather (for like other defaulters, I like to lay half the blame on ill fortune and adverse circumstances) was thrust on to a wrong tack at the age of one-and-twenty, and have never recovered the right course since: but I might have been very different; I might have been as good as you--wiser--almost as stainless.  I envy you your peace of mind, your clean conscience, your unpolluted memory.  Little girl, a memory without blot or contamination must be an exquisite treasure--an inexhaustible source of pure refreshment: is it not?

2658-2658	How was your memory when you were eighteen, sir?

2659-2665	All right then; limpid, salubrious: no gush of bilge water had turned it to fetid puddle.  I was your equal at eighteen--quite your equal.  Nature meant me to be, on the whole, a good man, Miss Eyre; one of the better kind, and you see I am not so.  You would say you don't see it; at least I flatter myself I read as much in your eye (beware, by-the-bye, what you express with that organ; I am quick at interpreting its language).  Then take my word for it,--I am not a villain: you are not to suppose that--not to attribute to me any such bad eminence; but, owing, I verily believe, rather to circumstances than to my natural bent, I am a trite commonplace sinner, hackneyed in all the poor petty dissipations with which the rich and worthless try to put on life.  Do you wonder that I avow this to you? Know, that in the course of your future life you will often find yourself elected the involuntary confidant of your acquaintances' secrets: people will instinctively find out, as I have done, that it is not your forte to tell of yourself, but to listen while others talk of themselves; they will feel, too, that you listen with no malevolent scorn of their indiscretion, but with a kind of innate sympathy; not the less comforting and encouraging because it is very unobtrusive in its manifestations.

2666-2667	How do you know?--how can you guess all this, sir?

2668-2673	I know it well; therefore I proceed almost as freely as if I were writing my thoughts in a diary.  You would say, I should have been superior to circumstances; so I should--so I should; but you see I was not.  When fate wronged me, I had not the wisdom to remain cool: I turned desperate; then I degenerated.  Now, when any vicious simpleton excites my disgust by his paltry ribaldry, I cannot flatter myself that I am better than he: I am forced to confess that he and I are on a level.  I wish I had stood firm--God knows I do!  Dread remorse when you are tempted to err, Miss Eyre; remorse is the poison of life.

2674-2674	Repentance is said to be its cure, sir.

2675-2677	It is not its cure.  Reformation may be its cure; and I could reform--I have strength yet for that--if--but where is the use of thinking of it, hampered, burdened, cursed as I am?  Besides, since happiness is irrevocably denied me, I have a right to get pleasure out of life: and I _will_ get it, cost what it may.

2678-2678	Then you will degenerate still more, sir.

2679-2680	Possibly: yet why should I, if I can get sweet, fresh pleasure?  And I may get it as sweet and fresh as the wild honey the bee gathers on the moor.

2681-2681	It will sting--it will taste bitter, sir.

2682-2683	How do you know?--you never tried it.  How very serious--how very solemn you look: and you are as ignorant of the matter as this cameo head

2685-2685	You have no right to preach to me, you neophyte, that have not passed the porch of life, and are absolutely unacquainted with its mysteries.

2686-2686	I only remind you of your own words, sir: you said error brought remorse, and you pronounced remorse the poison of existence.

2687-2692	And who talks of error now?  I scarcely think the notion that flittered across my brain was an error.  I believe it was an inspiration rather than a temptation: it was very genial, very soothing--I know that.  Here it comes again!  It is no devil, I assure you; or if it be, it has put on the robes of an angel of light.  I think I must admit so fair a guest when it asks entrance to my heart.

2693-2693	Distrust it, sir; it is not a true angel.

2694-2695	Once more, how do you know?  By what instinct do you pretend to distinguish between a fallen seraph of the abyss and a messenger from the eternal throne--between a guide and a seducer?

2696-2697	I judged by your countenance, sir, which was troubled when you said the suggestion had returned upon you.  I feel sure it will work you more misery if you listen to it.

2698-2699	Not at all--it bears the most gracious message in the world: for the rest, you are not my conscience-keeper, so don't make yourself uneasy. Here, come in, bonny wanderer!

2-2	Now,

2701-2702	I have received the pilgrim--a disguised deity, as I verily believe.  Already it has done me good: my heart was a sort of charnel; it will now be a shrine.

2703-2705	To speak truth, sir, I don't understand you at all: I cannot keep up the conversation, because it has got out of my depth.  Only one thing, I know: you said you were not as good as you should like to be, and that you regretted your own imperfection;--one thing I can comprehend: you intimated that to have a sullied memory was a perpetual bane.  It seems to me, that if you tried hard, you would in time find it possible to become what you yourself would approve; and that if from this day you began with resolution to correct your thoughts and actions, you would in a few years have laid up a new and stainless store of recollections, to which you might revert with pleasure.

2706-2706	Justly thought; rightly said, Miss Eyre; and, at this moment, I am paving hell with energy.

2707-2707	Sir?

2708-2709	I am laying down good intentions, which I believe durable as flint. Certainly, my associates and pursuits shall be other than they have been.

2710-2710	And better?

2711-2712	And better--so much better as pure ore is than foul dross.  You seem to doubt me; I don't doubt myself: I know what my aim is, what my motives are; and at this moment I pass a law, unalterable as that of the Medes and Persians, that both are right.

2713-2713	They cannot be, sir, if they require a new statute to legalise them.

2714-2714	They are, Miss Eyre, though they absolutely require a new statute: unheard-of combinations of circumstances demand unheard-of rules.

2715-2715	That sounds a dangerous maxim, sir; because one can see at once that it is liable to abuse.

2716-2717	Sententious sage! so it is: but I swear by my household gods not to abuse it.

2718-2718	You are human and fallible.

2719-2719	I am: so are you--what then?

2720-2720	The human and fallible should not arrogate a power with which the divine and perfect alone can be safely intrusted.

2721-2721	What power?

2722-2722	That of saying of any strange, unsanctioned line of action,--'Let it be right.'

2723-2723	'Let it be right'--the very words: you have pronounced them.

2-2	_May_ it be right then,

2725-2725	Where are you going?

2726-2726	To put Adele to bed: it is past her bedtime.

2727-2727	You are afraid of me, because I talk like a Sphynx.

2728-2728	Your language is enigmatical, sir: but though I am bewildered, I am certainly not afraid.

2729-2729	You _are_ afraid--your self-love dreads a blunder.

2730-2730	In that sense I do feel apprehensive--I have no wish to talk nonsense.

2731-2736	If you did, it would be in such a grave, quiet manner, I should mistake it for sense.  Do you never laugh, Miss Eyre?  Don't trouble yourself to answer--I see you laugh rarely; but you can laugh very merrily: believe me, you are not naturally austere, any more than I am naturally vicious. The Lowood constraint still clings to you somewhat; controlling your features, muffling your voice, and restricting your limbs; and you fear in the presence of a man and a brother--or father, or master, or what you will--to smile too gaily, speak too freely, or move too quickly: but, in time, I think you will learn to be natural with me, as I find it impossible to be conventional with you; and then your looks and movements will have more vivacity and variety than they dare offer now.  I see at intervals the glance of a curious sort of bird through the close-set bars of a cage: a vivid, restless, resolute captive is there; were it but free, it would soar cloud-high.  You are still bent on going?

2737-2737	It has struck nine, sir.

2738-2746	Never mind,--wait a minute: Adele is not ready to go to bed yet.  My position, Miss Eyre, with my back to the fire, and my face to the room, favours observation.  While talking to you, I have also occasionally watched Adele (I have my own reasons for thinking her a curious study,--reasons that I may, nay, that I shall, impart to you some day). She pulled out of her box, about ten minutes ago, a little pink silk frock; rapture lit her face as she unfolded it; coquetry runs in her blood, blends with her brains, and seasons the marrow of her bones.  'Il faut que je l'essaie!' cried she, 'et a l'instant meme!' and she rushed out of the room.  She is now with Sophie, undergoing a robing process: in a few minutes she will re-enter; and I know what I shall see,--a miniature of Celine Varens, as she used to appear on the boards at the rising of--But never mind that.  However, my tenderest feelings are about to receive a shock: such is my presentiment; stay now, to see whether it will be realised.

2750-2750	Est-ce que ma robe va bien?

2751-2753	et mes souliers? et mes bas?  Tenez, je crois que je vais danser!

2-2	Monsieur, je vous remercie mille fois de votre bonte;

2755-2755	C'est comme cela que maman faisait, n'est-ce pas, monsieur?

2756-2756	Pre-cise-ly!

2757-2763	and, 'comme cela,' she charmed my English gold out of my British breeches' pocket.  I have been green, too, Miss Eyre,--ay, grass green: not a more vernal tint freshens you now than once freshened me.  My Spring is gone, however, but it has left me that French floweret on my hands, which, in some moods, I would fain be rid of.  Not valuing now the root whence it sprang; having found that it was of a sort which nothing but gold dust could manure, I have but half a liking to the blossom, especially when it looks so artificial as just now.  I keep it and rear it rather on the Roman Catholic principle of expiating numerous sins, great or small, by one good work.  I'll explain all this some day. Good-night.

2767-2767	_grande passion_.

2769-2769	_taille d'athlete_

2770-2778	And, Miss Eyre, so much was I flattered by this preference of the Gallic sylph for her British gnome, that I installed her in an hotel; gave her a complete establishment of servants, a carriage, cashmeres, diamonds, dentelles, &c.  In short, I began the process of ruining myself in the received style, like any other spoony.  I had not, it seems, the originality to chalk out a new road to shame and destruction, but trode the old track with stupid exactness not to deviate an inch from the beaten centre.  I had--as I deserved to have--the fate of all other spoonies.  Happening to call one evening when Celine did not expect me, I found her out; but it was a warm night, and I was tired with strolling through Paris, so I sat down in her boudoir; happy to breathe the air consecrated so lately by her presence.  No,--I exaggerate; I never thought there was any consecrating virtue about her: it was rather a sort of pastille perfume she had left; a scent of musk and amber, than an odour of sanctity.  I was just beginning to stifle with the fumes of conservatory flowers and sprinkled essences, when I bethought myself to open the window and step out on to the balcony.  It was moonlight and gaslight besides, and very still and serene.  The balcony was furnished with a chair or two; I sat down, and took out a cigar,--I will take one now, if you will excuse me.

2779-2782	I liked bonbons too in those days, Miss Eyre, and I was _croquant_--(overlook the barbarism)--_croquant_ chocolate comfits, and smoking alternately, watching meantime the equipages that rolled along the fashionable streets towards the neighbouring opera-house, when in an elegant close carriage drawn by a beautiful pair of English horses, and distinctly seen in the brilliant city-night, I recognised the 'voiture' I had given Celine.  She was returning: of course my heart thumped with impatience against the iron rails I leant upon.  The carriage stopped, as I had expected, at the hotel door; my flame (that is the very word for an opera inamorata) alighted: though muffed in a cloak--an unnecessary encumbrance, by-the-bye, on so warm a June evening--I knew her instantly by her little foot, seen peeping from the skirt of her dress, as she skipped from the carriage-step.  Bending over the balcony, I was about to murmur 'Mon ange'--in a tone, of course, which should be audible to the ear of love alone--when a figure jumped from the carriage after her; cloaked also; but that was a spurred heel which had rung on the pavement, and that was a hatted head which now passed under the arched _porte cochere_ of the hotel.

2783-2788	You never felt jealousy, did you, Miss Eyre?  Of course not: I need not ask you; because you never felt love.  You have both sentiments yet to experience: your soul sleeps; the shock is yet to be given which shall waken it.  You think all existence lapses in as quiet a flow as that in which your youth has hitherto slid away.  Floating on with closed eyes and muffled ears, you neither see the rocks bristling not far off in the bed of the flood, nor hear the breakers boil at their base.  But I tell you--and you may mark my words--you will come some day to a craggy pass in the channel, where the whole of life's stream will be broken up into whirl and tumult, foam and noise: either you will be dashed to atoms on crag points, or lifted up and borne on by some master-wave into a calmer current--as I am now.

2789-2790	I like this day; I like that sky of steel; I like the sternness and stillness of the world under this frost.  I like Thornfield, its antiquity, its retirement, its old crow-trees and thorn-trees, its grey facade, and lines of dark windows reflecting that metal welkin: and yet how long have I abhorred the very thought of it, shunned it like a great plague-house?  How I do still abhor--

2796-2800	During the moment I was silent, Miss Eyre, I was arranging a point with my destiny.  She stood there, by that beech-trunk--a hag like one of those who appeared to Macbeth on the heath of Forres.  'You like Thornfield?' she said, lifting her finger; and then she wrote in the air a memento, which ran in lurid hieroglyphics all along the house-front, between the upper and lower row of windows, 'Like it if you can!  Like it if you dare!'

2-2	'I will like it,' said I; 'I dare like it;' and

2801-2802	I will keep my word; I will break obstacles to happiness, to goodness--yes, goodness.  I wish to be a better man than I have been, than I am; as Job's leviathan broke the spear, the dart, and the habergeon, hindrances which others count as iron and brass, I will esteem but straw and rotten wood.

2804-2804	Away!

2805-2805	keep at a distance, child; or go in to Sophie!

2-2	Did you leave the balcony, sir,

2806-2807	when Mdlle. Varens entered?

2809-2812	Oh, I had forgotten Celine!  Well, to resume.  When I saw my charmer thus come in accompanied by a cavalier, I seemed to hear a hiss, and the green snake of jealousy, rising on undulating coils from the moonlit balcony, glided within my waistcoat, and ate its way in two minutes to my heart's core. Strange!

2814-2818	Strange that I should choose you for the confidant of all this, young lady; passing strange that you should listen to me quietly, as if it were the most usual thing in the world for a man like me to tell stories of his opera-mistresses to a quaint, inexperienced girl like you!  But the last singularity explains the first, as I intimated once before: you, with your gravity, considerateness, and caution were made to be the recipient of secrets.  Besides, I know what sort of a mind I have placed in communication with my own: I know it is one not liable to take infection: it is a peculiar mind: it is a unique one.  Happily I do not mean to harm it: but, if I did, it would not take harm from me.  The more you and I converse, the better; for while I cannot blight you, you may refresh me.

2819-2826	I remained in the balcony.  'They will come to her boudoir, no doubt,' thought I: 'let me prepare an ambush.'  So putting my hand in through the open window, I drew the curtain over it, leaving only an opening through which I could take observations; then I closed the casement, all but a chink just wide enough to furnish an outlet to lovers' whispered vows: then I stole back to my chair; and as I resumed it the pair came in.  My eye was quickly at the aperture.  Celine's chamber-maid entered, lit a lamp, left it on the table, and withdrew.  The couple were thus revealed to me clearly: both removed their cloaks, and there was 'the Varens,' shining in satin and jewels,--my gifts of course,--and there was her companion in an officer's uniform; and I knew him for a young roue of a vicomte--a brainless and vicious youth whom I had sometimes met in society, and had never thought of hating because I despised him so absolutely.  On recognising him, the fang of the snake Jealousy was instantly broken; because at the same moment my love for Celine sank under an extinguisher.  A woman who could betray me for such a rival was not worth contending for; she deserved only scorn; less, however, than I, who had been her dupe.

2827-2830	They began to talk; their conversation eased me completely: frivolous, mercenary, heartless, and senseless, it was rather calculated to weary than enrage a listener.  A card of mine lay on the table; this being perceived, brought my name under discussion.  Neither of them possessed energy or wit to belabour me soundly, but they insulted me as coarsely as they could in their little way: especially Celine, who even waxed rather brilliant on my personal defects--deformities she termed them.  Now it had been her custom to launch out into fervent admiration of what she called my '_beaute male_:' wherein she differed diametrically from you, who told me point-blank, at the second interview, that you did not think me handsome.  The contrast struck me at the time and--

2832-2832	Monsieur, John has just been to say that your agent has called and wishes to see you.

2833-2842	Ah! in that case I must abridge.  Opening the window, I walked in upon them; liberated Celine from my protection; gave her notice to vacate her hotel; offered her a purse for immediate exigencies; disregarded screams, hysterics, prayers, protestations, convulsions; made an appointment with the vicomte for a meeting at the Bois de Boulogne.  Next morning I had the pleasure of encountering him; left a bullet in one of his poor etiolated arms, feeble as the wing of a chicken in the pip, and then thought I had done with the whole crew.  But unluckily the Varens, six months before, had given me this filette Adele, who, she affirmed, was my daughter; and perhaps she may be, though I see no proofs of such grim paternity written in her countenance: Pilot is more like me than she. Some years after I had broken with the mother, she abandoned her child, and ran away to Italy with a musician or singer.  I acknowledged no natural claim on Adele's part to be supported by me, nor do I now acknowledge any, for I am not her father; but hearing that she was quite destitute, I e'en took the poor thing out of the slime and mud of Paris, and transplanted it here, to grow up clean in the wholesome soil of an English country garden.  Mrs. Fairfax found you to train it; but now you know that it is the illegitimate offspring of a French opera-girl, you will perhaps think differently of your post and protegee: you will be coming to me some day with notice that you have found another place--that you beg me to look out for a new governess, &c.--Eh?

2843-2844	No: Adele is not answerable for either her mother's faults or yours: I have a regard for her; and now that I know she is, in a sense, parentless--forsaken by her mother and disowned by you, sir--I shall cling closer to her than before.  How could I possibly prefer the spoilt pet of a wealthy family, who would hate her governess as a nuisance, to a lonely little orphan, who leans towards her as a friend?

2845-2846	Oh, that is the light in which you view it!  Well, I must go in now; and you too: it darkens.

2876-2876	Why not?

2878-2883	What alienates him from the house?  Will he leave it again soon?  Mrs. Fairfax said he seldom stayed here longer than a fortnight at a time; and he has now been resident eight weeks.  If he does go, the change will be doleful.  Suppose he should be absent spring, summer, and autumn: how joyless sunshine and fine days will seem!

2891-2891	Who is there?

2902-2902	Who is there?

2905-2906	Was that Grace Poole? and is she possessed with a devil?

2920-2921	Wake! wake!

2929-2929	Is there a flood?

2-2	No, sir,

2931-2931	but there has been a fire: get up, do; you are quenched now; I will fetch you a candle.

2932-2932	In the name of all the elves in Christendom, is that Jane Eyre?

2934-2936	What have you done with me, witch, sorceress?  Who is in the room besides you?  Have you plotted to drown me?

2937-2938	I will fetch you a candle, sir; and, in Heaven's name, get up.  Somebody has plotted something: you cannot too soon find out who and what it is.

2939-2941	There!  I am up now; but at your peril you fetch a candle yet: wait two minutes till I get into some dry garments, if any dry there be--yes, here is my dressing-gown.  Now run!

2944-2945	What is it? and who did it?

2948-2948	What is it and who did it?

2951-2952	Shall I call Mrs. Fairfax?

2954-2958	Mrs. Fairfax?  No; what the deuce would you call her for?  What can she do?  Let her sleep unmolested.

2959-2959	Then I will fetch Leah, and wake John and his wife.

2960-2968	Not at all: just be still.  You have a shawl on.  If you are not warm enough, you may take my cloak yonder; wrap it about you, and sit down in the arm-chair: there,--I will put it on.  Now place your feet on the stool, to keep them out of the wet.  I am going to leave you a few minutes.  I shall take the candle.  Remain where you are till I return; be as still as a mouse.  I must pay a visit to the second storey.  Don't move, remember, or call any one.

2970-2970	I hope it is he,

2977-2977	and not something worse.

2979-2979	I have found it all out,

2979-2979	it is as I thought.

2980-2980	How, sir?

2982-2982	I forget whether you said you saw anything when you opened your chamber door.

2983-2983	No, sir, only the candlestick on the ground.

2984-2985	But you heard an odd laugh?  You have heard that laugh before, I should think, or something like it?

2986-2987	Yes, sir: there is a woman who sews here, called Grace Poole,--she laughs in that way.  She is a singular person.

2988-2993	Just so.  Grace Poole--you have guessed it.  She is, as you say, singular--very.  Well, I shall reflect on the subject.  Meantime, I am glad that you are the only person, besides myself, acquainted with the precise details of to-night's incident.  You are no talking fool: say nothing about it.  I will account for this state of affairs

2994-2996	and now return to your own room.  I shall do very well on the sofa in the library for the rest of the night.  It is near four:--in two hours the servants will be up.

2-2	Good-night, then, sir,

2999-2999	What!

3000-3000	are you quitting me already, and in that way?

3001-3001	You said I might go, sir.

3002-3006	But not without taking leave; not without a word or two of acknowledgment and good-will: not, in short, in that brief, dry fashion. Why, you have saved my life!--snatched me from a horrible and excruciating death! and you walk past me as if we were mutual strangers! At least shake hands.

3008-3010	You have saved my life: I have a pleasure in owing you so immense a debt.  I cannot say more.  Nothing else that has being would have been tolerable to me in the character of creditor for such an obligation: but you: it is different;--I feel your benefits no burden, Jane.

3012-3013	Good-night again, sir.  There is no debt, benefit, burden, obligation, in the case.

2-2	I knew,

4-4	you would do me good in some way, at some time;--I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you: their expression and smile did not

6-6	did not

3014-3016	strike delight to my very inmost heart so for nothing.  People talk of natural sympathies; I have heard of good genii: there are grains of truth in the wildest fable.  My cherished preserver, goodnight!

2-2	I am glad I happened to be awake,

3019-3020	What! you _will_ go?

3021-3021	I am cold, sir.

3022-3024	Cold?  Yes,--and standing in a pool!  Go, then, Jane; go!

3027-3027	I think I hear Mrs. Fairfax move, sir,

2-2	Well, leave me:

3041-3041	What a mercy master was not burnt in his bed!

3042-3042	It is always dangerous to keep a candle lit at night.

3043-3043	How providential that he had presence of mind to think of the water-jug!

3044-3044	I wonder he waked nobody!

3046-3046	It is to be hoped he will not take cold with sleeping on the library sofa,

3051-3051	Good morning, Miss,

2-2	I will put her to some test,

3055-3055	such absolute impenetrability is past comprehension.

2-2	Good morning, Grace,

3057-3058	Has anything happened here?  I thought I heard the servants all talking together a while ago.

3059-3059	Only master had been reading in his bed last night; he fell asleep with his candle lit, and the curtains got on fire; but, fortunately, he awoke before the bed-clothes or the wood-work caught, and contrived to quench the flames with the water in the ewer.

3060-3060	A strange affair!

3061-3063	Did Mr. Rochester wake nobody?  Did no one hear him move?

3065-3068	The servants sleep so far off, you know, Miss, they would not be likely to hear.  Mrs. Fairfax's room and yours are the nearest to master's; but Mrs. Fairfax said she heard nothing: when people get elderly, they often sleep heavy.

3069-3069	But you are young, Miss; and I should say a light sleeper: perhaps you may have heard a noise?

2-2	I did,

3070-3070	and at first I thought it was Pilot: but Pilot cannot laugh; and I am certain I heard a laugh, and a strange one.

3071-3071	It is hardly likely master would laugh, I should think, Miss, when he was in such danger: You must have been dreaming.

2-2	I was not dreaming,

3074-3074	Have you told master that you heard a laugh?

3076-3076	I have not had the opportunity of speaking to him this morning.

3077-3077	You did not think of opening your door and looking out into the gallery?

2-2	On the contrary,

3081-3081	I bolted my door.

3082-3082	Then you are not in the habit of bolting your door every night before you get into bed?

3083-3084	Fiend! she wants to know my habits, that she may lay her plans accordingly!

3085-3085	Hitherto I have often omitted to fasten the bolt: I did not think it necessary.  I was not aware any danger or annoyance was to be dreaded at Thornfield Hall: but in future

3086-3086	I shall take good care to make all secure before I venture to lie down.

2-2	It will be wise so to do,

3087-3089	this neighbourhood is as quiet as any I know, and I never heard of the hall being attempted by robbers since it was a house; though there are hundreds of pounds' worth of plate in the plate-closet, as is well known.  And you see, for such a large house, there are very few servants, because master has never lived here much; and when he does come, being a bachelor, he needs little waiting on: but I always think it best to err on the safe side; a door is soon fastened, and it is as well to have a drawn bolt between one and any mischief that may be about.  A deal of people, Miss, are for trusting all to Providence; but I say Providence will not dispense with the means, though He often blesses them when they are used discreetly.

3092-3092	Mrs. Poole,

3093-3093	the servants' dinner will soon be ready: will you come down?

3094-3094	No; just put my pint of porter and bit of pudding on a tray, and I'll carry it upstairs.

3095-3095	You'll have some meat?

3096-3096	Just a morsel, and a taste of cheese, that's all.

3097-3097	And the sago?

3098-3098	Never mind it at present: I shall be coming down before teatime: I'll make it myself.

3107-3107	Yet,

3108-3113	she has been young once; her youth would be contemporary with her master's: Mrs. Fairfax told me once, she had lived here many years.  I don't think she can ever have been pretty; but, for aught I know, she may possess originality and strength of character to compensate for the want of personal advantages.  Mr. Rochester is an amateur of the decided and eccentric: Grace is eccentric at least.  What if a former caprice (a freak very possible to a nature so sudden and headstrong as his) has delivered him into her power, and she now exercises over his actions a secret influence, the result of his own indiscretion, which he cannot shake off, and dare not disregard?

3115-3116	No; impossible! my supposition cannot be correct.  Yet,

3117-3118	you are not beautiful either, and perhaps Mr. Rochester approves you: at any rate, you have often felt as if he did; and last night--remember his words; remember his look; remember his voice!

3122-3122	Qu' avez-vous, mademoiselle?

3124-3124	Vos doigts tremblent comme la feuille, et vos joues sont rouges: mais, rouges comme des cerises!

3125-3125	I am hot, Adele, with stooping!

2-2	Evening approaches,

3132-3133	I have never heard Mr. Rochester's voice or step in the house to-day; but surely I shall see him before night: I feared the meeting in the morning; now I desire it, because expectation has been so long baffled that it is grown impatient.

2-2	You must want your tea,

3148-3148	you ate so little at dinner.  I am afraid,

3149-3149	you are not well to- day: you look flushed and feverish.

3150-3151	Oh, quite well!  I never felt better.

3152-3152	Then you must prove it by evincing a good appetite; will you fill the teapot while I knit off this needle?

2-2	It is fair to-night,

3154-3155	though not starlight; Mr. Rochester has, on the whole, had a favourable day for his journey.

3156-3159	Journey!--Is Mr. Rochester gone anywhere?  I did not know he was out.

3160-3163	Oh, he set off the moment he had breakfasted!  He is gone to the Leas, Mr. Eshton's place, ten miles on the other side Millcote.  I believe there is quite a party assembled there; Lord Ingram, Sir George Lynn, Colonel Dent, and others.

3164-3164	Do you expect him back to-night?

3165-3167	No--nor to-morrow either; I should think he is very likely to stay a week or more: when these fine, fashionable people get together, they are so surrounded by elegance and gaiety, so well provided with all that can please and entertain, they are in no hurry to separate.  Gentlemen especially are often in request on such occasions; and Mr. Rochester is so talented and so lively in society, that I believe he is a general favourite: the ladies are very fond of him; though you would not think his appearance calculated to recommend him particularly in their eyes: but I suppose his acquirements and abilities, perhaps his wealth and good blood, make amends for any little fault of look.

3168-3168	Are there ladies at the Leas?

3169-3174	There are Mrs. Eshton and her three daughters--very elegant young ladies indeed; and there are the Honourable Blanche and Mary Ingram, most beautiful women, I suppose: indeed I have seen Blanche, six or seven years since, when she was a girl of eighteen.  She came here to a Christmas ball and party Mr. Rochester gave.  You should have seen the dining-room that day--how richly it was decorated, how brilliantly lit up!  I should think there were fifty ladies and gentlemen present--all of the first county families; and Miss Ingram was considered the belle of the evening.

3175-3176	You saw her, you say, Mrs. Fairfax: what was she like?

3177-3181	Yes, I saw her.  The dining-room doors were thrown open; and, as it was Christmas-time, the servants were allowed to assemble in the hall, to hear some of the ladies sing and play.  Mr. Rochester would have me to come in, and I sat down in a quiet corner and watched them.  I never saw a more splendid scene: the ladies were magnificently dressed; most of them--at least most of the younger ones--looked handsome; but Miss Ingram was certainly the queen.

3182-3182	And what was she like?

3183-3187	Tall, fine bust, sloping shoulders; long, graceful neck: olive complexion, dark and clear; noble features; eyes rather like Mr. Rochester's: large and black, and as brilliant as her jewels.  And then she had such a fine head of hair; raven-black and so becomingly arranged: a crown of thick plaits behind, and in front the longest, the glossiest curls I ever saw.  She was dressed in pure white; an amber-coloured scarf was passed over her shoulder and across her breast, tied at the side, and descending in long, fringed ends below her knee.  She wore an amber-coloured flower, too, in her hair: it contrasted well with the jetty mass of her curls.

3188-3188	She was greatly admired, of course?

3189-3192	Yes, indeed: and not only for her beauty, but for her accomplishments. She was one of the ladies who sang: a gentleman accompanied her on the piano.  She and Mr. Rochester sang a duet.

3193-3195	Mr. Rochester?  I was not aware he could sing.

3196-3197	Oh! he has a fine bass voice, and an excellent taste for music.

3198-3198	And Miss Ingram: what sort of a voice had she?

3199-3201	A very rich and powerful one: she sang delightfully; it was a treat to listen to her;--and she played afterwards.  I am no judge of music, but Mr. Rochester is; and I heard him say her execution was remarkably good.

3202-3202	And this beautiful and accomplished lady, she is not yet married?

3203-3204	It appears not: I fancy neither she nor her sister have very large fortunes.  Old Lord Ingram's estates were chiefly entailed, and the eldest son came in for everything almost.

3205-3207	But I wonder no wealthy nobleman or gentleman has taken a fancy to her: Mr. Rochester, for instance.  He is rich, is he not?

3208-3211	Oh! yes.  But you see there is a considerable difference in age: Mr. Rochester is nearly forty; she is but twenty-five.

3212-3213	What of that?  More unequal matches are made every day.

3214-3216	True: yet I should scarcely fancy Mr. Rochester would entertain an idea of the sort.  But you eat nothing: you have scarcely tasted since you began tea.

3217-3218	No: I am too thirsty to eat.  Will you let me have another cup?

2-2	_You_,

3223-3238	a favourite with Mr. Rochester?  _You_ gifted with the power of pleasing him?  _You_ of importance to him in any way?  Go! your folly sickens me.  And you have derived pleasure from occasional tokens of preference--equivocal tokens shown by a gentleman of family and a man of the world to a dependent and a novice.  How dared you?  Poor stupid dupe!--Could not even self-interest make you wiser? You repeated to yourself this morning the brief scene of last night?--Cover your face and be ashamed!  He said something in praise of your eyes, did he?  Blind puppy!  Open their bleared lids and look on your own accursed senselessness!  It does good to no woman to be flattered by her superior, who cannot possibly intend to marry her; and it is madness in all women to let a secret love kindle within them, which, if unreturned and unknown, must devour the life that feeds it; and, if discovered and responded to, must lead, _ignis-fatus_-like, into miry wilds whence there is no extrication.

3239-3239	Listen, then, Jane Eyre, to your sentence: to-morrow, place the glass before you, and draw in chalk your own picture, faithfully, without softening one defect; omit no harsh line, smooth away no displeasing irregularity; write under it, 'Portrait of a Governess, disconnected, poor, and plain.'

3240-3249	Afterwards, take a piece of smooth ivory--you have one prepared in your drawing-box: take your palette, mix your freshest, finest, clearest tints; choose your most delicate camel-hair pencils; delineate carefully the loveliest face you can imagine; paint it in your softest shades and sweetest lines, according to the description given by Mrs. Fairfax of Blanche Ingram; remember the raven ringlets, the oriental eye;--What! you revert to Mr. Rochester as a model!  Order!  No snivel!--no sentiment!--no regret!  I will endure only sense and resolution.  Recall the august yet harmonious lineaments, the Grecian neck and bust; let the round and dazzling arm be visible, and the delicate hand; omit neither diamond ring nor gold bracelet; portray faithfully the attire, aerial lace and glistening satin, graceful scarf and golden rose; call it 'Blanche, an accomplished lady of rank.'

3250-3252	Whenever, in future, you should chance to fancy Mr. Rochester thinks well of you, take out these two pictures and compare them: say, 'Mr. Rochester might probably win that noble lady's love, if he chose to strive for it; is it likely he would waste a serious thought on this indigent and insignificant plebeian?'

2-2	I'll do it,

3267-3269	You have nothing to do with the master of Thornfield, further than to receive the salary he gives you for teaching his protegee, and to be grateful for such respectful and kind treatment as, if you do your duty, you have a right to expect at his hands.  Be sure that is the only tie he seriously acknowledges between you and him; so don't make him the object of your fine feelings, your raptures, agonies, and so forth.  He is not of your order: keep to your caste, and be too self-respecting to lavish the love of the whole heart, soul, and strength, where such a gift is not wanted and would be despised.

2-2	It is from the master,

3275-3275	Now I suppose we shall know whether we are to expect his return or not.

2-2	Well, I sometimes think we are too quiet; but we run a chance of being busy enough now: for a little while at least,

3280-3281	Mr. Rochester is not likely to return soon, I suppose?

3282-3283	Indeed he is--in three days, he says: that will be next Thursday; and not alone either.  I don't know how many of the fine people at the Leas are coming with him: he sends directions for all the best bedrooms to be prepared; and the library and drawing-rooms are to be cleaned out; I am to get more kitchen hands from the George Inn, at Millcote, and from wherever else I can; and the ladies will bring their maids and the gentlemen their valets: so we shall have a full house of it.

3287-3287	toilettes,

3289-3289	_passees_,

3302-3302	She gets good wages, I guess?

2-2	Yes,

3303-3307	I wish I had as good; not that mine are to complain of,--there's no stinginess at Thornfield; but they're not one fifth of the sum Mrs. Poole receives.  And she is laying by: she goes every quarter to the bank at Millcote.  I should not wonder but she has saved enough to keep her independent if she liked to leave; but I suppose she's got used to the place; and then she's not forty yet, and strong and able for anything.  It is too soon for her to give up business.

2-2	She is a good hand, I daresay,

3309-3309	Ah!--she understands what she has to do,--nobody better,

3310-3310	and it is not every one could fill her shoes--not for all the money she gets.

3311-3311	That it is not!

3313-3313	I wonder whether the master--

3314-3314	Doesn't she know?

3324-3324	a very pleasant refuge in time of trouble.

2-2	It gets late,

3329-3331	I am glad I ordered dinner an hour after the time Mr. Rochester mentioned; for it is past six now.  I have sent John down to the gates to see if there is anything on the road: one can see a long way from thence in the direction of Millcote.

3333-3333	Here he is!

3335-3335	Well, John

3335-3335	any news?

2-2	They're coming, ma'am,

3337-3337	They'll be here in ten minutes.

3344-3344	Miss Ingram!

3348-3348	Some natural tears she shed

2-2	Elles changent de toilettes,

2-2	Chez maman,

3354-3354	quand il y avait du monde, je le suivais partout, au salon et a leurs chambres; souvent je regardais les femmes de chambre coiffer et habiller les dames, et c'etait si amusant: comme cela on apprend.

3355-3355	Don't you feel hungry, Adele?

3356-3356	Mais oui, mademoiselle: voila cinq ou six heures que nous n'avons pas mange.

3357-3357	Well now, while the ladies are in their rooms, I will venture down and get you something to eat.

3368-3368	What beautiful ladies!

3370-3372	Oh, I wish I might go to them!  Do you think Mr. Rochester will send for us by-and-bye, after dinner?

3373-3375	No, indeed, I don't; Mr. Rochester has something else to think about. Never mind the ladies to-night; perhaps you will see them to-morrow: here is your dinner.

3381-3381	et alors quel dommage!

2-2	You said it was not likely they should think of being married,

3397-3398	but you see Mr. Rochester evidently prefers her to any of the other ladies.

3399-3399	Yes, I daresay: no doubt he admires her.

2-2	And she him,

3400-3400	look how she leans her head towards him as if she were conversing confidentially; I wish I could see her face; I have never had a glimpse of it yet.

2-2	You will see her this evening,

3403-3405	I happened to remark to Mr. Rochester how much Adele wished to be introduced to the ladies, and he said: 'Oh! let her come into the drawing-room after dinner; and request Miss Eyre to accompany her.'

2-2	Yes; he said that from mere politeness: I need not go, I am sure,

3407-3408	Well, I observed to him that as you were unused to company, I did not think you would like appearing before so gay a party--all strangers; and he replied, in his quick way--'Nonsense!  If she objects, tell her it is my particular wish; and if she resists, say I shall come and fetch her in case of contumacy.'

2-2	I will not give him that trouble,

3410-3412	I will go, if no better may be; but I don't like it.  Shall you be there, Mrs. Fairfax?

3413-3416	No; I pleaded off, and he admitted my plea.  I'll tell you how to manage so as to avoid the embarrassment of making a formal entrance, which is the most disagreeable part of the business.  You must go into the drawing- room while it is empty, before the ladies leave the dinner-table; choose your seat in any quiet nook you like; you need not stay long after the gentlemen come in, unless you please: just let Mr. Rochester see you are there and then slip away--nobody will notice you.

3417-3417	Will these people remain long, do you think?

3418-3420	Perhaps two or three weeks, certainly not more.  After the Easter recess, Sir George Lynn, who was lately elected member for Millcote, will have to go up to town and take his seat; I daresay Mr. Rochester will accompany him: it surprises me that he has already made so protracted a stay at Thornfield.

3433-3433	What is it, Adele?

3434-3435	Est-ce que je ne puis pas prendrie une seule de ces fleurs magnifiques, mademoiselle?  Seulement pour completer ma toilette.

3436-3436	You think too much of your 'toilette,' Adele: but you may have a flower.

3479-3479	especially wild ones;

3494-3494	Bon jour, mesdames.

3495-3495	Oh, what a little puppet!

3496-3497	It is Mr. Rochester's ward, I suppose--the little French girl he was speaking of.

3500-3500	What a love of a child!

3509-3509	pere noble de theatre.

3522-3522	beauty is in the eye of the gazer.

3527-3527	He is not to them what he is to me,

3535-3543	he is not of their kind.  I believe he is of mine;--I am sure he is--I feel akin to him--I understand the language of his countenance and movements: though rank and wealth sever us widely, I have something in my brain and heart, in my blood and nerves, that assimilates me mentally to him.  Did I say, a few days since, that I had nothing to do with him but to receive my salary at his hands?  Did I forbid myself to think of him in any other light than as a paymaster?  Blasphemy against nature!  Every good, true, vigorous feeling I have gathers impulsively round him.  I know I must conceal my sentiments: I must smother hope; I must remember that he cannot care much for me.  For when I say that I am of his kind, I do not mean that I have his force to influence, and his spell to attract; I mean only that I have certain tastes and feelings in common with him.  I must, then, repeat continually that we are for ever sundered:--and yet, while I breathe and think, I must love him.

3560-3561	Mr. Rochester, I thought you were not fond of children?

3562-3562	Nor am I.

3563-3563	Then, what induced you to take charge of such a little doll as that?

3565-3565	Where did you pick her up?

3566-3566	I did not pick her up; she was left on my hands.

3567-3567	You should have sent her to school.

3568-3568	I could not afford it: schools are so dear.

3569-3572	Why, I suppose you have a governess for her: I saw a person with her just now--is she gone?  Oh, no! there she is still, behind the window- curtain.  You pay her, of course; I should think it quite as expensive,--more so; for you have them both to keep in addition.

2-2	I have not considered the subject,

3577-3578	No, you men never do consider economy and common sense.  You should hear mama on the chapter of governesses: Mary and I have had, I should think, a dozen at least in our day; half of them detestable and the rest ridiculous, and all incubi--were they not, mama?

3579-3579	Did you speak, my own?

3581-3583	My dearest, don't mention governesses; the word makes me nervous.  I have suffered a martyrdom from their incompetency and caprice.  I thank Heaven I have now done with them!

3586-3586	Tant pis!

3587-3587	I hope it may do her good!

3588-3588	I noticed her; I am a judge of physiognomy, and in hers I see all the faults of her class.

3589-3589	What are they, madam?

2-2	I will tell you in your private ear,

3593-3593	But my curiosity will be past its appetite; it craves food now.

3594-3594	Ask Blanche; she is nearer you than I.

3595-3605	Oh, don't refer him to me, mama!  I have just one word to say of the whole tribe; they are a nuisance.  Not that I ever suffered much from them; I took care to turn the tables.  What tricks Theodore and I used to play on our Miss Wilsons, and Mrs. Greys, and Madame Jouberts!  Mary was always too sleepy to join in a plot with spirit.  The best fun was with Madame Joubert: Miss Wilson was a poor sickly thing, lachrymose and low- spirited, not worth the trouble of vanquishing, in short; and Mrs. Grey was coarse and insensible; no blow took effect on her.  But poor Madame Joubert!  I see her yet in her raging passions, when we had driven her to extremities--spilt our tea, crumbled our bread and butter, tossed our books up to the ceiling, and played a charivari with the ruler and desk, the fender and fire-irons.  Theodore, do you remember those merry days?

2-2	Yaas, to be sure I do,

3606-3607	and the poor old stick used to cry out 'Oh you villains childs!'--and then we sermonised her on the presumption of attempting to teach such clever blades as we were, when she was herself so ignorant.

3608-3612	We did; and, Tedo, you know, I helped you in prosecuting (or persecuting) your tutor, whey-faced Mr. Vining--the parson in the pip, as we used to call him.  He and Miss Wilson took the liberty of falling in love with each other--at least Tedo and I thought so; we surprised sundry tender glances and sighs which we interpreted as tokens of 'la belle passion,' and I promise you the public soon had the benefit of our discovery; we employed it as a sort of lever to hoist our dead-weights from the house.  Dear mama, there, as soon as she got an inkling of the business, found out that it was of an immoral tendency.  Did you not, my lady-mother?

3613-3613	Certainly, my best.  And I was quite right: depend on that: there are a thousand reasons why liaisons between governesses and tutors should never be tolerated a moment in any well-regulated house; firstly--

3614-3617	Oh, gracious, mama!  Spare us the enumeration!  _Au reste_, we all know them: danger of bad example to innocence of childhood; distractions and consequent neglect of duty on the part of the attached--mutual alliance and reliance; confidence thence resulting--insolence accompanying--mutiny and general blow-up.  Am I right, Baroness Ingram, of Ingram Park?

3618-3618	My lily-flower, you are right now, as always.

3619-3619	Then no more need be said: change the subject.

3620-3621	Louisa and I used to quiz our governess too; but she was such a good creature, she would bear anything: nothing put her out.  She was never cross with us; was she, Louisa?

3622-3622	No, never: we might do what we pleased; ransack her desk and her workbox, and turn her drawers inside out; and she was so good-natured, she would give us anything we asked for.

2-2	I suppose, now,

3623-3625	we shall have an abstract of the memoirs of all the governesses extant: in order to avert such a visitation, I again move the introduction of a new topic.  Mr. Rochester, do you second my motion?

3626-3626	Madam, I support you on this point, as on every other.

3627-3628	Then on me be the onus of bringing it forward.  Signior Eduardo, are you in voice to-night?

3629-3629	Donna Bianca, if you command it, I will be.

3630-3630	Then, signior, I lay on you my sovereign behest to furbish up your lungs and other vocal organs, as they will be wanted on my royal service.

3631-3631	Who would not be the Rizzio of so divine a Mary?

3632-3632	A fig for Rizzio!

3634-3634	It is my opinion the fiddler David must have been an insipid sort of fellow; I like black Bothwell better: to my mind a man is nothing without a spice of the devil in him; and history may say what it will of James Hepburn, but I have a notion, he was just the sort of wild, fierce, bandit hero whom I could have consented to gift with my hand.

3635-3636	Gentlemen, you hear!  Now which of you most resembles Bothwell?

2-2	I should say the preference lies with you,

2-2	On my honour, I am much obliged to you,

3643-3643	Oh, I am so sick of the young men of the present day!

3645-3649	Poor, puny things, not fit to stir a step beyond papa's park gates: nor to go even so far without mama's permission and guardianship!  Creatures so absorbed in care about their pretty faces, and their white hands, and their small feet; as if a man had anything to do with beauty!  As if loveliness were not the special prerogative of woman--her legitimate appanage and heritage!  I grant an ugly _woman_ is a blot on the fair face of creation; but as to the _gentlemen_, let them be solicitous to possess only strength and valour: let their motto be:--Hunt, shoot, and fight: the rest is not worth a fillip.  Such should be my device, were I a man.

2-2	Whenever I marry,

3650-3653	I am resolved my husband shall not be a rival, but a foil to me.  I will suffer no competitor near the throne; I shall exact an undivided homage: his devotions shall not be shared between me and the shape he sees in his mirror.  Mr. Rochester, now sing, and I will play for you.

2-2	I am all obedience,

3655-3656	Here then is a Corsair-song.  Know that I doat on Corsairs; and for that reason, sing it _con spirito_.

3657-3657	Commands from Miss Ingram's lips would put spirit into a mug of milk and water.

3658-3658	Take care, then: if you don't please me, I will shame you by showing how such things _should_ be done.

3659-3659	That is offering a premium on incapacity: I shall now endeavour to fail.

3660-3661	Gardez-vous en bien!  If you err wilfully, I shall devise a proportionate punishment.

3662-3662	Miss Ingram ought to be clement, for she has it in her power to inflict a chastisement beyond mortal endurance.

3663-3664	Ha! explain!

3666-3666	Pardon me, madam: no need of explanation; your own fine sense must inform you that one of your frowns would be a sufficient substitute for capital punishment.

3667-3667	Sing!

2-2	Now is my time to slip away,

3677-3677	How do you do?

3679-3679	I am very well, sir.

3680-3680	Why did you not come and speak to me in the room?

3682-3682	I did not wish to disturb you, as you seemed engaged, sir.

3683-3683	What have you been doing during my absence?

3684-3684	Nothing particular; teaching Adele as usual.

3685-3686	And getting a good deal paler than you were--as I saw at first sight. What is the matter?

3687-3687	Nothing at all, sir.

3688-3688	Did you take any cold that night you half drowned me?

3689-3689	Not the least.

3690-3690	Return to the drawing-room: you are deserting too early.

3691-3691	I am tired, sir.

2-2	And a little depressed,

3694-3695	What about?  Tell me.

3696-3697	Nothing--nothing, sir.  I am not depressed.

3698-3701	But I affirm that you are: so much depressed that a few more words would bring tears to your eyes--indeed, they are there now, shining and swimming; and a bead has slipped from the lash and fallen on to the flag. If I had time, and was not in mortal dread of some prating prig of a servant passing, I would know what all this means.  Well, to-night I excuse you; but understand that so long as my visitors stay, I expect you to appear in the drawing-room every evening; it is my wish; don't neglect it.  Now go, and send Sophie for Adele.  Good-night, my--

2-2	playing charades,

3716-3716	Miss Ingram is mine, of course,

3721-3721	Will you play?

2-2	No,

3728-3728	she looks too stupid for any game of the sort.

3739-3739	Bride!

3752-3752	She hasted, let down her pitcher on her hand, and gave him to drink.

3756-3756	the tableau of the whole;

3763-3763	Bridewell!

2-2	Do you know,

3768-3769	that, of the three characters, I liked you in the last best?  Oh, had you but lived a few years earlier, what a gallant gentleman-highwayman you would have made!

3770-3770	Is all the soot washed from my face?

3772-3774	Alas! yes: the more's the pity!  Nothing could be more becoming to your complexion than that ruffian's rouge.

3775-3775	You would like a hero of the road then?

3776-3776	An English hero of the road would be the next best thing to an Italian bandit; and that could only be surpassed by a Levantine pirate.

3777-3777	Well, whatever I am, remember you are my wife; we were married an hour since, in the presence of all these witnesses.

2-2	Now, Dent,

3780-3780	it is your turn.

3810-3810	Why can she not influence him more, when she is privileged to draw so near to him?

3812-3817	Surely she cannot truly like him, or not like him with true affection!  If she did, she need not coin her smiles so lavishly, flash her glances so unremittingly, manufacture airs so elaborate, graces so multitudinous.  It seems to me that she might, by merely sitting quietly at his side, saying little and looking less, get nigher his heart.  I have seen in his face a far different expression from that which hardens it now while she is so vivaciously accosting him; but then it came of itself: it was not elicited by meretricious arts and calculated manoeuvres; and one had but to accept it--to answer what he asked without pretension, to address him when needful without grimace--and it increased and grew kinder and more genial, and warmed one like a fostering sunbeam.  How will she manage to please him when they are married?  I do not think she will manage it; and yet it might be managed; and his wife might, I verily believe, be the very happiest woman the sun shines on.

3851-3851	Voila, Monsieur Rochester, qui revient!

3854-3854	What can possess him to come home in that style?

3856-3857	He rode Mesrour (the black horse), did he not, when he went out? and Pilot was with him:--what has he done with the animals?

3861-3861	How provoking!

3862-3862	you tiresome monkey!

3863-3863	who perched you up in the window to give false intelligence?

2-2	It appears I come at an inopportune time, madam,

3867-3868	when my friend, Mr. Rochester, is from home; but I arrive from a very long journey, and I think I may presume so far on old and intimate acquaintance as to instal myself here till he returns.

3883-3883	extremes meet.

3886-3886	a beautiful man.

3888-3888	a love of a creature,

3890-3890	adored him;

3892-3892	pretty little mouth, and nice nose,

3888-3888	And what a sweet-tempered forehead he has!

3889-3889	so smooth--none of those frowning irregularities I dislike so much; and such a placid eye and smile!

3901-3901	old woman,

3904-3904	quite troublesome.

2-2	Tell her she shall be put in the stocks if she does not take herself off,

3906-3906	No--stop!

3908-3908	Don't send her away, Eshton; we might turn the thing to account; better consult the ladies.

3909-3910	Ladies, you talked of going to Hay Common to visit the gipsy camp; Sam here says that one of the old Mother Bunches is in the servants' hall at this moment, and insists upon being brought in before 'the quality,' to tell them their fortunes.  Would you like to see her?

2-2	Surely, colonel,

3911-3912	you would not encourage such a low impostor?  Dismiss her, by all means, at once!

2-2	But I cannot persuade her to go away, my lady,

3913-3914	nor can any of the servants: Mrs. Fairfax is with her just now, entreating her to be gone; but she has taken a chair in the chimney-corner, and says nothing shall stir her from it till she gets leave to come in here.

3915-3915	What does she want?

3918-3918	'To tell the gentry their fortunes,' she says, ma'am; and she swears she must and will do it.

3919-3919	What is she like?

3921-3921	A shockingly ugly old creature, miss; almost as black as a crock.

3922-3922	Why, she's a real sorceress!

3924-3924	Let us have her in, of course.

2-2	To be sure,

3925-3925	it would be a thousand pities to throw away such a chance of fun.

3926-3926	My dear boys, what are you thinking about?

2-2	I cannot possibly countenance any such inconsistent proceeding,

2-2	Indeed, mama, but you can--and will,

3931-3931	I have a curiosity to hear my fortune told: therefore, Sam, order the beldame forward.

3932-3932	My darling Blanche! recollect--

3933-3933	I do--I recollect all you can suggest; and I must have my will--quick, Sam!

3934-3934	Yes--yes--yes!

3936-3936	Let her come--it will be excellent sport!

3938-3938	She looks such a rough one,

3939-3939	Go!

2-2	She won't come now,

3943-3944	She says it's not her mission to appear before the 'vulgar herd' (them's her words).  I must show her into a room by herself, and then those who wish to consult her must go to her one by one.

2-2	You see now, my queenly Blanche,

3945-3945	she encroaches.  Be advised, my angel girl--and--

2-2	Show her into the library, of course,

3946-3946	angel girl.

3947-3948	It is not my mission to listen to her before the vulgar herd either: I mean to have her all to myself.  Is there a fire in the library?

3949-3949	Yes, ma'am--but she looks such a tinkler.

3950-3951	Cease that chatter, blockhead! and do my bidding.

2-2	She's ready now,

3954-3954	She wishes to know who will be her first visitor.

2-2	I think I had better just look in upon her before any of the ladies go,

3956-3956	Tell her, Sam, a gentleman is coming.

2-2	She says, sir, that she'll have no gentlemen; they need not trouble themselves to come near her; nor,

3958-3958	any ladies either, except the young, and single.

3959-3959	By Jove, she has taste!

2-2	I go first,

3962-3964	Oh, my best! oh, my dearest! pause--reflect!

3967-3967	le cas

3975-3975	Well, Blanche?

3977-3977	What did she say, sister?

3979-3981	What did you think?  How do you feel?--Is she a real fortune-teller?

2-2	Now, now, good people,

3983-3987	don't press upon me. Really your organs of wonder and credulity are easily excited: you seem, by the importance of you all--my good mama included--ascribe to this matter, absolutely to believe we have a genuine witch in the house, who is in close alliance with the old gentleman.  I have seen a gipsy vagabond; she has practised in hackneyed fashion the science of palmistry and told me what such people usually tell.  My whim is gratified; and now I think Mr. Eshton will do well to put the hag in the stocks to-morrow morning, as he threatened.

3995-3995	I am sure she is something not right!

3997-3998	She told us such things!  She knows all about us!

4005-4007	If you please, miss, the gipsy declares that there is another young single lady in the room who has not been to her yet, and she swears she will not go till she has seen all.  I thought it must be you: there is no one else for it.  What shall I tell her?

2-2	Oh, I will go by all means,

2-2	If you like, miss,

4010-4010	I'll wait in the hall for you; and if she frightens you, just call and I'll come in.

4011-4011	No, Sam, return to the kitchen: I am not in the least afraid.

4020-4020	Well, and you want your fortune told?

4022-4022	I don't care about it, mother; you may please yourself: but I ought to warn you, I have no faith.

4023-4023	It's like your impudence to say so: I expected it of you; I heard it in your step as you crossed the threshold.

4024-4025	Did you?  You've a quick ear.

4026-4026	I have; and a quick eye and a quick brain.

4027-4027	You need them all in your trade.

4028-4029	I do; especially when I've customers like you to deal with.  Why don't you tremble?

4030-4030	I'm not cold.

4031-4031	Why don't you turn pale?

4032-4032	I am not sick.

4033-4033	Why don't you consult my art?

4034-4034	I'm not silly.

2-2	nichered

4036-4036	You are cold; you are sick; and you are silly.

2-2	Prove it,

4038-4041	I will, in few words.  You are cold, because you are alone: no contact strikes the fire from you that is in you.  You are sick; because the best of feelings, the highest and the sweetest given to man, keeps far away from you.  You are silly, because, suffer as you may, you will not beckon it to approach, nor will you stir one step to meet it where it waits you.

4043-4043	You might say all that to almost any one who you knew lived as a solitary dependent in a great house.

4044-4044	I might say it to almost any one: but would it be true of almost any one?

4045-4045	In my circumstances.

4046-4046	Yes; just so, in _your_ circumstances: but find me another precisely placed as you are.

4047-4047	It would be easy to find you thousands.

4048-4051	You could scarcely find me one.  If you knew it, you are peculiarly situated: very near happiness; yes, within reach of it.  The materials are all prepared; there only wants a movement to combine them.  Chance laid them somewhat apart; let them be once approached and bliss results.

4052-4053	I don't understand enigmas.  I never could guess a riddle in my life.

4054-4054	If you wish me to speak more plainly, show me your palm.

4055-4055	And I must cross it with silver, I suppose?

4056-4056	To be sure.

2-2	It is too fine,

4061-4062	I can make nothing of such a hand as that; almost without lines: besides, what is in a palm?  Destiny is not written there.

2-2	I believe you,

2-2	No,

4064-4065	it is in the face: on the forehead, about the eyes, in the lines of the mouth.  Kneel, and lift up your head.

4066-4066	Ah! now you are coming to reality,

4068-4068	I shall begin to put some faith in you presently.

2-2	I wonder with what feelings you came to me to-night,

4072-4072	I wonder what thoughts are busy in your heart during all the hours you sit in yonder room with the fine people flitting before you like shapes in a magic-lantern: just as little sympathetic communion passing between you and them as if they were really mere shadows of human forms, and not the actual substance.

4073-4073	I feel tired often, sleepy sometimes, but seldom sad.

4074-4074	Then you have some secret hope to buoy you up and please you with whispers of the future?

4075-4076	Not I.  The utmost I hope is, to save money enough out of my earnings to set up a school some day in a little house rented by myself.

2-2	A mean nutriment for the spirit to exist on: and sitting in that window- seat (you see I know your habits )--

4077-4077	You have learned them from the servants.

4078-4080	Ah! you think yourself sharp.  Well, perhaps I have: to speak truth, I have an acquaintance with one of them, Mrs. Poole--

4082-4082	You have--have you?

4083-4083	there is diablerie in the business after all, then!

2-2	Don't be alarmed,

4084-4089	she's a safe hand is Mrs. Poole: close and quiet; any one may repose confidence in her.  But, as I was saying: sitting in that window-seat, do you think of nothing but your future school?  Have you no present interest in any of the company who occupy the sofas and chairs before you?  Is there not one face you study? one figure whose movements you follow with at least curiosity?

4090-4090	I like to observe all the faces and all the figures.

4091-4091	But do you never single one from the rest--or it may be, two?

4092-4092	I do frequently; when the gestures or looks of a pair seem telling a tale: it amuses me to watch them.

4093-4093	What tale do you like best to hear?

4094-4095	Oh, I have not much choice!  They generally run on the same theme--courtship; and promise to end in the same catastrophe--marriage.

4096-4096	And do you like that monotonous theme?

4097-4097	Positively, I don't care about it: it is nothing to me.

4098-4098	Nothing to you?  When a lady, young and full of life and health, charming with beauty and endowed with the gifts of rank and fortune, sits and smiles in the eyes of a gentleman you--

4099-4099	I what?

4100-4100	You know--and perhaps think well of.

4101-4102	I don't know the gentlemen here.  I have scarcely interchanged a syllable with one of them; and as to thinking well of them, I consider some respectable, and stately, and middle-aged, and others young, dashing, handsome, and lively: but certainly they are all at liberty to be the recipients of whose smiles they please, without my feeling disposed to consider the transaction of any moment to me.

4103-4105	You don't know the gentlemen here?  You have not exchanged a syllable with one of them?  Will you say that of the master of the house!

4106-4106	He is not at home.

4107-4109	A profound remark!  A most ingenious quibble!  He went to Millcote this morning, and will be back here to-night or to-morrow: does that circumstance exclude him from the list of your acquaintance--blot him, as it were, out of existence?

4110-4111	No; but I can scarcely see what Mr. Rochester has to do with the theme you had introduced.

4112-4113	I was talking of ladies smiling in the eyes of gentlemen; and of late so many smiles have been shed into Mr. Rochester's eyes that they overflow like two cups filled above the brim: have you never remarked that?

4114-4115	Mr. Rochester has a right to enjoy the society of his guests.

4116-4117	No question about his right: but have you never observed that, of all the tales told here about matrimony, Mr. Rochester has been favoured with the most lively and the most continuous?

4118-4118	The eagerness of a listener quickens the tongue of a narrator.

4121-4121	Eagerness of a listener!

4122-4124	yes; Mr. Rochester has sat by the hour, his ear inclined to the fascinating lips that took such delight in their task of communicating; and Mr. Rochester was so willing to receive and looked so grateful for the pastime given him; you have noticed this?

4125-4126	Grateful!  I cannot remember detecting gratitude in his face.

4127-4129	Detecting!  You have analysed, then.  And what did you detect, if not gratitude?

4131-4132	You have seen love: have you not?--and, looking forward, you have seen him married, and beheld his bride happy?

4133-4135	Humph!  Not exactly.  Your witch's skill is rather at fault sometimes.

4136-4136	What the devil have you seen, then?

4137-4139	Never mind: I came here to inquire, not to confess.  Is it known that Mr. Rochester is to be married?

4140-4140	Yes; and to the beautiful Miss Ingram.

4141-4141	Shortly?

4142-4145	Appearances would warrant that conclusion: and, no doubt (though, with an audacity that wants chastising out of you, you seem to question it), they will be a superlatively happy pair.  He must love such a handsome, noble, witty, accomplished lady; and probably she loves him, or, if not his person, at least his purse.  I know she considers the Rochester estate eligible to the last degree; though (God pardon me!) I told her something on that point about an hour ago which made her look wondrous grave: the corners of her mouth fell half an inch.  I would advise her blackaviced suitor to look out: if another comes, with a longer or clearer rent-roll,--he's dished--

4146-4147	But, mother, I did not come to hear Mr. Rochester's fortune: I came to hear my own; and you have told me nothing of it.

4148-4154	Your fortune is yet doubtful: when I examined your face, one trait contradicted another.  Chance has meted you a measure of happiness: that I know.  I knew it before I came here this evening.  She has laid it carefully on one side for you.  I saw her do it.  It depends on yourself to stretch out your hand, and take it up: but whether you will do so, is the problem I study.  Kneel again on the rug.

4155-4155	Don't keep me long; the fire scorches me.

4159-4161	The flame flickers in the eye; the eye shines like dew; it looks soft and full of feeling; it smiles at my jargon: it is susceptible; impression follows impression through its clear sphere; where it ceases to smile, it is sad; an unconscious lassitude weighs on the lid: that signifies melancholy resulting from loneliness.  It turns from me; it will not suffer further scrutiny; it seems to deny, by a mocking glance, the truth of the discoveries I have already made,--to disown the charge both of sensibility and chagrin: its pride and reserve only confirm me in my opinion.  The eye is favourable.

4162-4164	As to the mouth, it delights at times in laughter; it is disposed to impart all that the brain conceives; though I daresay it would be silent on much the heart experiences.  Mobile and flexible, it was never intended to be compressed in the eternal silence of solitude: it is a mouth which should speak much and smile often, and have human affection for its interlocutor.  That feature too is propitious.

4165-4170	I see no enemy to a fortunate issue but in the brow; and that brow professes to say,--'I can live alone, if self-respect, and circumstances require me so to do.  I need not sell my soul to buy bliss.  I have an inward treasure born with me, which can keep me alive if all extraneous delights should be withheld, or offered only at a price I cannot afford to give.'  The forehead declares, 'Reason sits firm and holds the reins, and she will not let the feelings burst away and hurry her to wild chasms.  The passions may rage furiously, like true heathens, as they are; and the desires may imagine all sorts of vain things: but judgment shall still have the last word in every argument, and the casting vote in every decision.  Strong wind, earthquake-shock, and fire may pass by: but I shall follow the guiding of that still small voice which interprets the dictates of conscience.'

4171-4179	Well said, forehead; your declaration shall be respected.  I have formed my plans--right plans I deem them--and in them I have attended to the claims of conscience, the counsels of reason.  I know how soon youth would fade and bloom perish, if, in the cup of bliss offered, but one dreg of shame, or one flavour of remorse were detected; and I do not want sacrifice, sorrow, dissolution--such is not my taste.  I wish to foster, not to blight--to earn gratitude, not to wring tears of blood--no, nor of brine: my harvest must be in smiles, in endearments, in sweet--That will do.  I think I rave in a kind of exquisite delirium.  I should wish now to protract this moment _ad infinitum_; but I dare not.  So far I have governed myself thoroughly.  I have acted as I inwardly swore I would act; but further might try me beyond my strength.  Rise, Miss Eyre: leave me; the play is played out'.

4190-4190	Well, Jane, do you know me?

2-2	Only take off the red cloak, sir, and then--

4192-4192	But the string is in a knot--help me.

4193-4193	Break it, sir.

4194-4194	There, then--'Off, ye lendings!'

4197-4197	Now, sir, what a strange idea!

4198-4199	But well carried out, eh?  Don't you think so?

4200-4200	With the ladies you must have managed well.

4201-4201	But not with you?

4202-4202	You did not act the character of a gipsy with me.

4203-4204	What character did I act?  My own?

4205-4207	No; some unaccountable one.  In short, I believe you have been trying to draw me out--or in; you have been talking nonsense to make me talk nonsense.  It is scarcely fair, sir.

4208-4208	Do you forgive me, Jane?

4209-4210	I cannot tell till I have thought it all over.  If, on reflection, I find I have fallen into no great absurdity, I shall try to forgive you; but it was not right.

4211-4211	Oh, you have been very correct--very careful, very sensible.

2-2	Well,

4219-4220	what are you musing about?  What does that grave smile signify?

4221-4222	Wonder and self-congratulation, sir.  I have your permission to retire now, I suppose?

4223-4223	No; stay a moment; and tell me what the people in the drawing-room yonder are doing.

4224-4224	Discussing the gipsy, I daresay.

4225-4226	Sit down!--Let me hear what they said about me.

4227-4229	I had better not stay long, sir; it must be near eleven o'clock.  Oh, are you aware, Mr. Rochester, that a stranger has arrived here since you left this morning?

4230-4232	A stranger!--no; who can it be?  I expected no one; is he gone?

4233-4233	No; he said he had known you long, and that he could take the liberty of installing himself here till you returned.

4234-4235	The devil he did!  Did he give his name?

4236-4236	His name is Mason, sir; and he comes from the West Indies; from Spanish Town, in Jamaica, I think.

4240-4241	Mason!--the West Indies!

4242-4243	Mason!--the West Indies!

4245-4245	Do you feel ill, sir?

4247-4247	Jane, I've got a blow; I've got a blow, Jane!

4249-4249	Oh, lean on me, sir.

4250-4250	Jane, you offered me your shoulder once before; let me have it now.

4251-4251	Yes, sir, yes; and my arm.

4254-4254	My little friend!

4255-4255	I wish I were in a quiet island with only you; and trouble, and danger, and hideous recollections removed from me.

4256-4257	Can I help you, sir?--I'd give my life to serve you.

4258-4258	Jane, if aid is wanted, I'll seek it at your hands; I promise you that.

4259-4260	Thank you, sir.  Tell me what to do,--I'll try, at least, to do it.

4261-4261	Fetch me now, Jane, a glass of wine from the dining-room: they will be at supper there; and tell me if Mason is with them, and what he is doing.

4273-4273	Here is to your health, ministrant spirit!

4276-4276	What are they doing, Jane?

4277-4277	Laughing and talking, sir.

4278-4278	They don't look grave and mysterious, as if they had heard something strange?

4279-4279	Not at all: they are full of jests and gaiety.

4280-4280	And Mason?

4281-4281	He was laughing too.

4282-4282	If all these people came in a body and spat at me, what would you do, Jane?

4283-4283	Turn them out of the room, sir, if I could.

4285-4286	But if I were to go to them, and they only looked at me coldly, and whispered sneeringly amongst each other, and then dropped off and left me one by one, what then?  Would you go with them?

4287-4287	I rather think not, sir: I should have more pleasure in staying with you.

4288-4288	To comfort me?

4289-4289	Yes, sir, to comfort you, as well as I could.

4290-4290	And if they laid you under a ban for adhering to me?

4291-4291	I, probably, should know nothing about their ban; and if I did, I should care nothing about it.

4292-4292	Then, you could dare censure for my sake?

4293-4293	I could dare it for the sake of any friend who deserved my adherence; as you, I am sure, do.

4294-4295	Go back now into the room; step quietly up to Mason, and whisper in his ear that Mr. Rochester is come and wishes to see him: show him in here and then leave me.

4296-4296	Yes, sir.

4302-4302	This way, Mason; this is your room.

4317-4319	Help! help! help!

4321-4321	Will no one come?

4322-4324	Rochester!  Rochester! for God's sake, come!

4329-4330	Oh! what is it?

4331-4331	Who is hurt?

4332-4332	What has happened?

4333-4333	Fetch a light!

4334-4334	Is it fire?

4335-4335	Are there robbers?

4336-4336	Where shall we run?

4340-4340	Where the devil is Rochester?

4342-4342	I cannot find him in his bed.

4343-4344	Here! here!

4346-4346	Be composed, all of you: I'm coming.

4350-4350	What awful event has taken place?

4352-4353	Speak! let us know the worst at once!

2-2	But don't pull me down or strangle me,

4355-4356	All's right!--all's right!

4358-4359	It's a mere rehearsal of Much Ado about Nothing.  Ladies, keep off, or I shall wax dangerous.

4361-4366	A servant has had the nightmare; that is all.  She's an excitable, nervous person: she construed her dream into an apparition, or something of that sort, no doubt; and has taken a fit with fright.  Now, then, I must see you all back into your rooms; for, till the house is settled, she cannot be looked after.  Gentlemen, have the goodness to set the ladies the example.  Miss Ingram, I am sure you will not fail in evincing superiority to idle terrors.  Amy and Louisa, return to your nests like a pair of doves, as you are.   Mesdames

4367-4367	you will take cold to a dead certainty, if you stay in this chill gallery any longer.

4381-4381	Am I wanted?

4383-4383	Are you up?

4386-4386	Yes, sir.

4387-4387	And dressed?

4388-4388	Yes.

4389-4389	Come out, then, quietly.

2-2	I want you,

4393-4393	come this way: take your time, and make no noise.

4396-4396	Have you a sponge in your room?

4398-4398	Yes, sir.

4399-4399	Have you any salts--volatile salts?

4400-4400	Yes.

4401-4401	Go back and fetch both.

4404-4404	You don't turn sick at the sight of blood?

4405-4405	I think I shall not: I have never been tried yet.

2-2	Just give me your hand,

4407-4407	it will not do to risk a fainting fit.

4409-4409	Warm and steady,

4411-4411	Wait a minute,

4419-4419	Here, Jane!

2-2	Hold the candle,

4425-4425	Hold that,

4432-4432	Is there immediate danger?

4435-4438	Pooh!  No--a mere scratch.  Don't be so overcome, man: bear up!  I'll fetch a surgeon for you now, myself: you'll be able to be removed by morning, I hope.  Jane,

4440-4440	Sir?

4441-4442	I shall have to leave you in this room with this gentleman, for an hour, or perhaps two hours: you will sponge the blood as I do when it returns: if he feels faint, you will put the glass of water on that stand to his lips, and your salts to his nose.  You will not speak to him on any pretext--and--Richard, it will be at the peril of your life if you speak to her: open your lips--agitate yourself--and I'll not answer for the consequences.

4446-4446	Remember!--No conversation,

4482-4482	Jane, I have got a blow--I have got a blow, Jane.

4484-4485	When will he come?  When will he come?

2-2	Now, Carter, be on the alert,

4495-4495	I give you but half-an-hour for dressing the wound, fastening the bandages, getting the patient downstairs and all.

4496-4496	But is he fit to move, sir?

4497-4498	No doubt of it; it is nothing serious; he is nervous, his spirits must be kept up.  Come, set to work.

4502-4502	Now, my good fellow, how are you?

2-2	She's done for me, I fear,

4505-4508	Not a whit!--courage!  This day fortnight you'll hardly be a pin the worse of it: you've lost a little blood; that's all.  Carter, assure him there's no danger.

2-2	I can do that conscientiously,

4509-4511	only I wish I could have got here sooner: he would not have bled so much--but how is this?  The flesh on the shoulder is torn as well as cut.  This wound was not done with a knife: there have been teeth here!

2-2	She bit me,

4513-4513	She worried me like a tigress, when Rochester got the knife from her.

2-2	You should not have yielded: you should have grappled with her at once,

4516-4516	But under such circumstances, what could one do?

4518-4518	Oh, it was frightful!

4520-4520	And I did not expect it: she looked so quiet at first.

2-2	I warned you,

4521-4522	I said--be on your guard when you go near her.  Besides, you might have waited till to-morrow, and had me with you: it was mere folly to attempt the interview to-night, and alone.

4523-4523	I thought I could have done some good.

4524-4529	You thought! you thought!  Yes, it makes me impatient to hear you: but, however, you have suffered, and are likely to suffer enough for not taking my advice; so I'll say no more.  Carter--hurry!--hurry!  The sun will soon rise, and I must have him off.

4530-4531	Directly, sir; the shoulder is just bandaged.  I must look to this other wound in the arm: she has had her teeth here too, I think.

2-2	She sucked the blood: she said she'd drain my heart,

4534-4534	Come, be silent, Richard, and never mind her gibberish: don't repeat it.

2-2	I wish I could forget it,

4536-4536	You will when you are out of the country: when you get back to Spanish Town, you may think of her as dead and buried--or rather, you need not think of her at all.

4537-4537	Impossible to forget this night!

4538-4541	It is not impossible: have some energy, man.  You thought you were as dead as a herring two hours since, and you are all alive and talking now. There!--Carter has done with you or nearly so; I'll make you decent in a trice.  Jane

4542-4542	take this key: go down into my bedroom, and walk straight forward into my dressing-room: open the top drawer of the wardrobe and take out a clean shirt and neck-handkerchief: bring them here; and be nimble.

2-2	Now,

4544-4544	go to the other side of the bed while I order his toilet; but don't leave the room: you may be wanted again.

4546-4546	Was anybody stirring below when you went down, Jane?

4549-4549	No, sir; all was very still.

4550-4557	We shall get you off cannily, Dick: and it will be better, both for your sake, and for that of the poor creature in yonder.  I have striven long to avoid exposure, and I should not like it to come at last.  Here, Carter, help him on with his waist-coat.  Where did you leave your furred cloak?  You can't travel a mile without that, I know, in this damned cold climate.  In your room?--Jane, run down to Mr. Mason's room,--the one next mine,--and fetch a cloak you will see there.

2-2	Now, I've another errand for you,

4559-4562	you must away to my room again.  What a mercy you are shod with velvet, Jane!--a clod-hopping messenger would never do at this juncture.  You must open the middle drawer of my toilet-table and take out a little phial and a little glass you will find there,--quick!

4564-4568	That's well!  Now, doctor, I shall take the liberty of administering a dose myself, on my own responsibility.  I got this cordial at Rome, of an Italian charlatan--a fellow you would have kicked, Carter.  It is not a thing to be used indiscriminately, but it is good upon occasion: as now, for instance.  Jane, a little water.

4570-4570	That will do;--now wet the lip of the phial.

4572-4572	Drink, Richard: it will give you the heart you lack, for an hour or so.

4573-4574	But will it hurt me?--is it inflammatory?

4575-4577	Drink! drink! drink!

2-2	Now I am sure you can get on your feet,

4582-4582	try.

4584-4585	Carter, take him under the other shoulder.  Be of good cheer, Richard; step out--that's it!

2-2	I do feel better,

4588-4589	I am sure you do.  Now, Jane, trip on before us away to the backstairs; unbolt the side-passage door, and tell the driver of the post-chaise you will see in the yard--or just outside, for I told him not to drive his rattling wheels over the pavement--to be ready; we are coming: and, Jane, if any one is about, come to the foot of the stairs and hem.

2-2	Take care of him,

4598-4599	and keep him at your house till he is quite well: I shall ride over in a day or two to see how he gets on.  Richard, how is it with you?

4600-4600	The fresh air revives me, Fairfax.

4601-4601	Leave the window open on his side, Carter; there is no wind--good-bye, Dick.

2-2	Fairfax--

4602-4602	Well what is it?

2-2	Let her be taken care of; let her be treated as tenderly as may be: let her--

2-2	I do my best; and have done it, and will do it,

4605-4605	Yet would to God there was an end of all this!

4609-4609	Jane!

2-2	Come where there is some freshness, for a few moments,

4611-4611	that house is a mere dungeon: don't you feel it so?

4612-4612	It seems to me a splendid mansion, sir.

2-2	The glamour of inexperience is over your eyes,

4613-4613	and you see it through a charmed medium: you cannot discern that the gilding is slime and the silk draperies cobwebs; that the marble is sordid slate, and the polished woods mere refuse chips and scaly bark.  Now _here_

4614-4614	all is real, sweet, and pure.

4617-4617	Jane, will you have a flower?

4619-4619	Thank you, sir.

4620-4621	Do you like this sunrise, Jane?  That sky with its high and light clouds which are sure to melt away as the day waxes warm--this placid and balmly atmosphere?

4622-4622	I do, very much.

4623-4623	You have passed a strange night, Jane.

4624-4624	Yes, sir.

4625-4625	And it has made you look pale--were you afraid when I left you alone with Mason?

4626-4626	I was afraid of some one coming out of the inner room.

4627-4627	But I had fastened the door--I had the key in my pocket: I should have been a careless shepherd if I had left a lamb--my pet lamb--so near a wolf's den, unguarded: you were safe.

4628-4628	Will Grace Poole live here still, sir?

4629-4630	Oh yes! don't trouble your head about her--put the thing out of your thoughts.

4631-4631	Yet it seems to me your life is hardly secure while she stays.

4632-4632	Never fear--I will take care of myself.

4633-4633	Is the danger you apprehended last night gone by now, sir?

4634-4635	I cannot vouch for that till Mason is out of England: nor even then.  To live, for me, Jane, is to stand on a crater-crust which may crack and spue fire any day.

4636-4638	But Mr. Mason seems a man easily led.  Your influence, sir, is evidently potent with him: he will never set you at defiance or wilfully injure you.

4639-4640	Oh, no!  Mason will not defy me; nor, knowing it, will he hurt me--but, unintentionally, he might in a moment, by one careless word, deprive me, if not of life, yet for ever of happiness.

4641-4641	Tell him to be cautious, sir: let him know what you fear, and show him how to avert the danger.

4643-4648	If I could do that, simpleton, where would the danger be?  Annihilated in a moment.  Ever since I have known Mason, I have only had to say to him 'Do that,' and the thing has been done.  But I cannot give him orders in this case: I cannot say 'Beware of harming me, Richard;' for it is imperative that I should keep him ignorant that harm to me is possible. Now you look puzzled; and I will puzzle you further.  You are my little friend, are you not?

4649-4649	I like to serve you, sir, and to obey you in all that is right.

4650-4653	Precisely: I see you do.  I see genuine contentment in your gait and mien, your eye and face, when you are helping me and pleasing me--working for me, and with me, in, as you characteristically say, '_all that is right_:' for if I bid you do what you thought wrong, there would be no light-footed running, no neat-handed alacrity, no lively glance and animated complexion.  My friend would then turn to me, quiet and pale, and would say, 'No, sir; that is impossible: I cannot do it, because it is wrong;' and would become immutable as a fixed star.  Well, you too have power over me, and may injure me: yet I dare not show you where I am vulnerable, lest, faithful and friendly as you are, you should transfix me at once.

4654-4655	If you have no more to fear from Mr. Mason than you have from me, sir, you are very safe.

4656-4657	God grant it may be so!  Here, Jane, is an arbour; sit down.

2-2	Sit,

4661-4663	the bench is long enough for two.  You don't hesitate to take a place at my side, do you?  Is that wrong, Jane?

4665-4665	Now, my little friend, while the sun drinks the dew--while all the flowers in this old garden awake and expand, and the birds fetch their young ones' breakfast out of the Thornfield, and the early bees do their first spell of work--I'll put a case to you, which you must endeavour to suppose your own: but first, look at me, and tell me you are at ease, and not fearing that I err in detaining you, or that you err in staying.

4666-4666	No, sir; I am content.

4667-4674	Well then, Jane, call to aid your fancy:--suppose you were no longer a girl well reared and disciplined, but a wild boy indulged from childhood upwards; imagine yourself in a remote foreign land; conceive that you there commit a capital error, no matter of what nature or from what motives, but one whose consequences must follow you through life and taint all your existence.  Mind, I don't say a _crime_; I am not speaking of shedding of blood or any other guilty act, which might make the perpetrator amenable to the law: my word is _error_.  The results of what you have done become in time to you utterly insupportable; you take measures to obtain relief: unusual measures, but neither unlawful nor culpable.  Still you are miserable; for hope has quitted you on the very confines of life: your sun at noon darkens in an eclipse, which you feel will not leave it till the time of setting.  Bitter and base associations have become the sole food of your memory: you wander here and there, seeking rest in exile: happiness in pleasure--I mean in heartless, sensual pleasure--such as dulls intellect and blights feeling. Heart-weary and soul-withered, you come home after years of voluntary banishment: you make a new acquaintance--how or where no matter: you find in this stranger much of the good and bright qualities which you have sought for twenty years, and never before encountered; and they are all fresh, healthy, without soil and without taint.  Such society revives, regenerates: you feel better days come back--higher wishes, purer feelings; you desire to recommence your life, and to spend what remains to you of days in a way more worthy of an immortal being.  To attain this end, are you justified in overleaping an obstacle of custom--a mere conventional impediment which neither your conscience sanctifies nor your judgment approves?

4680-4680	Is the wandering and sinful, but now rest-seeking and repentant, man justified in daring the world's opinion, in order to attach to him for ever this gentle, gracious, genial stranger, thereby securing his own peace of mind and regeneration of life?

2-2	Sir,

4681-4682	a wanderer's repose or a sinner's reformation should never depend on a fellow-creature.  Men and women die; philosophers falter in wisdom, and Christians in goodness: if any one you know has suffered and erred, let him look higher than his equals for strength to amend and solace to heal.

4683-4684	But the instrument--the instrument!  God, who does the work, ordains the instrument.  I have myself--I tell it you without parable--been a worldly, dissipated, restless man; and I believe I have found the instrument for my cure in--

2-2	Little friend,

4688-4688	you have noticed my tender penchant for Miss Ingram: don't you think if I married her she would regenerate me with a vengeance?

2-2	Jane, Jane,

4690-4690	you are quite pale with your vigils: don't you curse me for disturbing your rest?

4691-4692	Curse you?  No, sir.

4693-4696	Shake hands in confirmation of the word.  What cold fingers!  They were warmer last night when I touched them at the door of the mysterious chamber.  Jane, when will you watch with me again?

4697-4697	Whenever I can be useful, sir.

4698-4701	For instance, the night before I am married!  I am sure I shall not be able to sleep.  Will you promise to sit up with me to bear me company?  To you I can talk of my lovely one: for now you have seen her and know her.

4702-4702	Yes, sir.

4703-4703	She's a rare one, is she not, Jane?

4704-4704	Yes, sir.

4705-4708	A strapper--a real strapper, Jane: big, brown, and buxom; with hair just such as the ladies of Carthage must have had.  Bless me! there's Dent and Lynn in the stables!  Go in by the shrubbery, through that wicket.

4709-4709	Mason got the start of you all this morning; he was gone before sunrise: I rose at four to see him off.

2-2	I daresay you hardly remember me, Miss,

4724-4725	but my name is Leaven: I lived coachman with Mrs. Reed when you were at Gateshead, eight or nine years since, and I live there still.

4726-4730	Oh, Robert! how do you do?  I remember you very well: you used to give me a ride sometimes on Miss Georgiana's bay pony.  And how is Bessie?  You are married to Bessie?

4731-4731	Yes, Miss: my wife is very hearty, thank you; she brought me another little one about two months since--we have three now--and both mother and child are thriving.

4732-4732	And are the family well at the house, Robert?

4733-4733	I am sorry I can't give you better news of them, Miss: they are very badly at present--in great trouble.

2-2	I hope no one is dead,

4735-4736	Mr. John died yesterday was a week, at his chambers in London.

4737-4738	Mr. John?

4739-4739	Yes.

4740-4740	And how does his mother bear it?

4741-4741	Why, you see, Miss Eyre, it is not a common mishap: his life has been very wild: these last three years he gave himself up to strange ways, and his death was shocking.

4742-4742	I heard from Bessie he was not doing well.

4743-4750	Doing well!  He could not do worse: he ruined his health and his estate amongst the worst men and the worst women.  He got into debt and into jail: his mother helped him out twice, but as soon as he was free he returned to his old companions and habits.  His head was not strong: the knaves he lived amongst fooled him beyond anything I ever heard.  He came down to Gateshead about three weeks ago and wanted missis to give up all to him.  Missis refused: her means have long been much reduced by his extravagance; so he went back again, and the next news was that he was dead.  How he died, God knows!--they say he killed himself.

4752-4759	Missis had been out of health herself for some time: she had got very stout, but was not strong with it; and the loss of money and fear of poverty were quite breaking her down.  The information about Mr. John's death and the manner of it came too suddenly: it brought on a stroke.  She was three days without speaking; but last Tuesday she seemed rather better: she appeared as if she wanted to say something, and kept making signs to my wife and mumbling.  It was only yesterday morning, however, that Bessie understood she was pronouncing your name; and at last she made out the words, 'Bring Jane--fetch Jane Eyre: I want to speak to her.'  Bessie is not sure whether she is in her right mind, or means anything by the words; but she told Miss Reed and Miss Georgiana, and advised them to send for you.  The young ladies put it off at first; but their mother grew so restless, and said, 'Jane, Jane,' so many times, that at last they consented.  I left Gateshead yesterday: and if you can get ready, Miss, I should like to take you back with me early to-morrow morning.

4760-4760	Yes, Robert, I shall be ready: it seems to me that I ought to go.

4761-4762	I think so too, Miss.  Bessie said she was sure you would not refuse: but I suppose you will have to ask leave before you can get off?

2-2	Yes; and I will do it now;

4771-4771	What can the creeping creature want now?

4772-4772	Mr. Rochester,

4776-4776	Does that person want you?

4778-4778	person

4781-4781	Well, Jane?

4783-4783	If you please, sir, I want leave of absence for a week or two.

4784-4785	What to do?--where to go?

4786-4786	To see a sick lady who has sent for me.

4787-4788	What sick lady?--where does she live?

4789-4789	At Gateshead; in ---shire.

4790-4792	-shire?  That is a hundred miles off!  Who may she be that sends for people to see her that distance?

4793-4794	Her name is Reed, sir--Mrs. Reed.

4795-4796	Reed of Gateshead?  There was a Reed of Gateshead, a magistrate.

4797-4797	It is his widow, sir.

4798-4799	And what have you to do with her?  How do you know her?

4800-4801	Mr. Reed was my uncle--my mother's brother.

4802-4803	The deuce he was!  You never told me that before: you always said you had no relations.

4804-4806	None that would own me, sir.  Mr. Reed is dead, and his wife cast me off.

4807-4807	Why?

4808-4808	Because I was poor, and burdensome, and she disliked me.

4809-4811	But Reed left children?--you must have cousins?  Sir George Lynn was talking of a Reed of Gateshead yesterday, who, he said, was one of the veriest rascals on town; and Ingram was mentioning a Georgiana Reed of the same place, who was much admired for her beauty a season or two ago in London.

4812-4813	John Reed is dead, too, sir: he ruined himself and half-ruined his family, and is supposed to have committed suicide.  The news so shocked his mother that it brought on an apoplectic attack.

4814-4816	And what good can you do her?  Nonsense, Jane!  I would never think of running a hundred miles to see an old lady who will, perhaps, be dead before you reach her: besides, you say she cast you off.

4817-4817	Yes, sir, but that is long ago; and when her circumstances were very different: I could not be easy to neglect her wishes now.

4818-4818	How long will you stay?

4819-4819	As short a time as possible, sir.

2-2	Promise me only to stay a week--

4820-4820	I had better not pass my word: I might be obliged to break it.

4821-4821	At all events you _will_ come back: you will not be induced under any pretext to take up a permanent residence with her?

4822-4823	Oh, no!  I shall certainly return if all be well.

4824-4825	And who goes with you?  You don't travel a hundred miles alone.

4826-4826	No, sir, she has sent her coachman.

4827-4827	A person to be trusted?

4828-4828	Yes, sir, he has lived ten years in the family.

4831-4831	When do you wish to go?

4832-4832	Early to-morrow morning, sir.

4833-4834	Well, you must have some money; you can't travel without money, and I daresay you have not much: I have given you no salary yet.  How much have you in the world, Jane?

4837-4837	Five shillings, sir.

4839-4839	Here,

4841-4842	I don't want change; you know that.  Take your wages.

4844-4846	Right, right!  Better not give you all now: you would, perhaps, stay away three months if you had fifty pounds.  There are ten; is it not plenty?

4847-4847	Yes, sir, but now you owe me five.

4848-4848	Come back for it, then; I am your banker for forty pounds.

4849-4850	Mr. Rochester, I may as well mention another matter of business to you while I have the opportunity.

4851-4852	Matter of business?  I am curious to hear it.

4853-4853	You have as good as informed me, sir, that you are going shortly to be married?

4854-4854	Yes; what then?

4855-4855	In that case, sir, Adele ought to go to school: I am sure you will perceive the necessity of it.

4856-4858	To get her out of my bride's way, who might otherwise walk over her rather too emphatically?  There's sense in the suggestion; not a doubt of it.  Adele, as you say, must go to school; and you, of course, must march straight to--the devil?

4859-4859	I hope not, sir; but I must seek another situation somewhere.

4860-4860	In course!

4863-4863	And old Madam Reed, or the Misses, her daughters, will be solicited by you to seek a place, I suppose?

4864-4864	No, sir; I am not on such terms with my relatives as would justify me in asking favours of them--but I shall advertise.

4865-4865	You shall walk up the pyramids of Egypt!

4867-4869	At your peril you advertise!  I wish I had only offered you a sovereign instead of ten pounds.  Give me back nine pounds, Jane; I've a use for it.

2-2	And so have I, sir,

4871-4871	I could not spare the money on any account.

4872-4872	Little niggard!

4873-4874	refusing me a pecuniary request!  Give me five pounds, Jane.

4875-4875	Not five shillings, sir; nor five pence.

4876-4876	Just let me look at the cash.

4877-4877	No, sir; you are not to be trusted.

4878-4878	Jane!

4879-4879	Sir?

4880-4880	Promise me one thing.

4881-4881	I'll promise you anything, sir, that I think I am likely to perform.

4882-4883	Not to advertise: and to trust this quest of a situation to me.  I'll find you one in time.

4884-4884	I shall be glad so to do, sir, if you, in your turn, will promise that I and Adele shall be both safe out of the house before your bride enters it.

4885-4888	Very well! very well!  I'll pledge my word on it.  You go to-morrow, then?

4889-4889	Yes, sir; early.

4890-4890	Shall you come down to the drawing-room after dinner?

4891-4891	No, sir, I must prepare for the journey.

4892-4892	Then you and I must bid good-bye for a little while?

4893-4893	I suppose so, sir.

4894-4895	And how do people perform that ceremony of parting, Jane?  Teach me; I'm not quite up to it.

4896-4896	They say, Farewell, or any other form they prefer.

4897-4897	Then say it.

4898-4899	Farewell, Mr. Rochester, for the present.

4900-4900	What must I say?

4901-4901	The same, if you like, sir.

4902-4902	Farewell, Miss Eyre, for the present; is that all?

4903-4903	Yes?

4904-4907	It seems stingy, to my notions, and dry, and unfriendly.  I should like something else: a little addition to the rite.  If one shook hands, for instance; but no--that would not content me either.  So you'll do no more than say Farewell, Jane?

4908-4908	It is enough, sir: as much good-will may be conveyed in one hearty word as in many.

4909-4909	Very likely; but it is blank and cool--'Farewell.'

4910-4910	How long is he going to stand with his back against that door?

4911-4911	I want to commence my packing.

4916-4917	Bless you!--I knew you would come!

2-2	Yes, Bessie,

4920-4923	and I trust I am not too late.  How is Mrs. Reed?--Alive still, I hope.

4924-4925	Yes, she is alive; and more sensible and collected than she was.  The doctor says she may linger a week or two yet; but he hardly thinks she will finally recover.

4926-4926	Has she mentioned me lately?

4927-4929	She was talking of you only this morning, and wishing you would come, but she is sleeping now, or was ten minutes ago, when I was up at the house.  She generally lies in a kind of lethargy all the afternoon, and wakes up about six or seven.  Will you rest yourself here an hour, Miss, and then I will go up with you?

2-2	You shall go into the breakfast-room first,

4946-4946	the young ladies will be there.

4959-4959	Miss Eyre.

4961-4961	How d'ye do?

4963-4963	quiz

4967-4968	How is Mrs. Reed?

4970-4973	Mrs. Reed?  Ah! mama, you mean; she is extremely poorly: I doubt if you can see her to-night.

2-2	If,

4974-4974	you would just step upstairs and tell her I am come, I should be much obliged to you.

4976-4976	I know she had a particular wish to see me,

4976-4976	and I would not defer attending to her desire longer than is absolutely necessary.

2-2	Mama dislikes being disturbed in an evening,

2-2	Missis is awake,

4984-4984	I have told her you are here: come and let us see if she will know you.

4998-4998	Is this Jane Eyre?

5000-5001	Yes, Aunt Reed.  How are you, dear aunt?

2-2	You sent for me,

5012-5012	and I am here; and it is my intention to stay till I see how you get on.

5013-5014	Oh, of course!  You have seen my daughters?

5015-5015	Yes.

5016-5016	Well, you may tell them I wish you to stay till I can talk some things over with you I have on my mind: to-night it is too late, and I have a difficulty in recalling them.  But there was something I wished to say--let me see--

5019-5019	Sit up!

5020-5021	don't annoy me with holding the clothes fast.  Are you Jane Eyre?

5022-5022	I am Jane Eyre.

5023-5028	I have had more trouble with that child than any one would believe.  Such a burden to be left on my hands--and so much annoyance as she caused me, daily and hourly, with her incomprehensible disposition, and her sudden starts of temper, and her continual, unnatural watchings of one's movements!  I declare she talked to me once like something mad, or like a fiend--no child ever spoke or looked as she did; I was glad to get her away from the house.  What did they do with her at Lowood?  The fever broke out there, and many of the pupils died.  She, however, did not die: but I said she did--I wish she had died!

5029-5030	A strange wish, Mrs. Reed; why do you hate her so?

5031-5046	I had a dislike to her mother always; for she was my husband's only sister, and a great favourite with him: he opposed the family's disowning her when she made her low marriage; and when news came of her death, he wept like a simpleton.  He would send for the baby; though I entreated him rather to put it out to nurse and pay for its maintenance.  I hated it the first time I set my eyes on it--a sickly, whining, pining thing! It would wail in its cradle all night long--not screaming heartily like any other child, but whimpering and moaning.  Reed pitied it; and he used to nurse it and notice it as if it had been his own: more, indeed, than he ever noticed his own at that age.  He would try to make my children friendly to the little beggar: the darlings could not bear it, and he was angry with them when they showed their dislike.  In his last illness, he had it brought continually to his bedside; and but an hour before he died, he bound me by vow to keep the creature.  I would as soon have been charged with a pauper brat out of a workhouse: but he was weak, naturally weak.  John does not at all resemble his father, and I am glad of it: John is like me and like my brothers--he is quite a Gibson.  Oh, I wish he would cease tormenting me with letters for money?  I have no more money to give him: we are getting poor.  I must send away half the servants and shut up part of the house; or let it off.  I can never submit to do that--yet how are we to get on?  Two-thirds of my income goes in paying the interest of mortgages.  John gambles dreadfully, and always loses--poor boy!  He is beset by sharpers: John is sunk and degraded--his look is frightful--I feel ashamed for him when I see him.

5048-5048	I think I had better leave her now,

5049-5049	Perhaps you had, Miss: but she often talks in this way towards night--in the morning she is calmer.

5051-5051	Stop!

5053-5057	there is another thing I wished to say.  He threatens me--he continually threatens me with his own death, or mine: and I dream sometimes that I see him laid out with a great wound in his throat, or with a swollen and blackened face.  I am come to a strange pass: I have heavy troubles.  What is to be done?  How is the money to be had?

5076-5076	Good! but not quite the thing,

5078-5078	they want more force and spirit;

5080-5080	Is that a portrait of some one you know?

5087-5087	an ugly man.

5104-5104	the Rubric.

5113-5116	Of course not.  Georgiana and she had nothing in common: they never had had.  She would not be burdened with her society for any consideration. Georgiana should take her own course; and she, Eliza, would take hers.

5118-5118	It would be so much better,

5118-5118	if she could only get out of the way for a month or two, till all was over.

5120-5120	all being over,

5121-5132	Georgiana, a more vain and absurd animal than you was certainly never allowed to cumber the earth.  You had no right to be born, for you make no use of life.  Instead of living for, in, and with yourself, as a reasonable being ought, you seek only to fasten your feebleness on some other person's strength: if no one can be found willing to burden her or himself with such a fat, weak, puffy, useless thing, you cry out that you are ill-treated, neglected, miserable.  Then, too, existence for you must be a scene of continual change and excitement, or else the world is a dungeon: you must be admired, you must be courted, you must be flattered--you must have music, dancing, and society--or you languish, you die away.  Have you no sense to devise a system which will make you independent of all efforts, and all wills, but your own?  Take one day; share it into sections; to each section apportion its task: leave no stray unemployed quarters of an hour, ten minutes, five minutes--include all; do each piece of business in its turn with method, with rigid regularity.  The day will close almost before you are aware it has begun; and you are indebted to no one for helping you to get rid of one vacant moment: you have had to seek no one's company, conversation, sympathy, forbearance; you have lived, in short, as an independent being ought to do.  Take this advice: the first and last I shall offer you; then you will not want me or any one else, happen what may.  Neglect it--go on as heretofore, craving, whining, and idling--and suffer the results of your idiocy, however bad and insuperable they may be.  I tell you this plainly; and listen: for though I shall no more repeat what I am now about to say, I shall steadily act on it.  After my mother's death, I wash my hands of you: from the day her coffin is carried to the vault in Gateshead Church, you and I will be as separate as if we had never known each other.  You need not think that because we chanced to be born of the same parents, I shall suffer you to fasten me down by even the feeblest claim: I can tell you this--if the whole human race, ourselves excepted, were swept away, and we two stood alone on the earth, I would leave you in the old world, and betake myself to the new.

2-2	You might have spared yourself the trouble of delivering that tirade,

5135-5135	Everybody knows you are the most selfish, heartless creature in existence: and _I_ know your spiteful hatred towards me: I have had a specimen of it before in the trick you played me about Lord Edwin Vere: you could not bear me to be raised above you, to have a title, to be received into circles where you dare not show your face, and so you acted the spy and informer, and ruined my prospects for ever.

2-2	One lies there,

5144-5145	who will soon be beyond the war of earthly elements.  Whither will that spirit--now struggling to quit its material tenement--flit when at length released?

5147-5147	Who is that?

5151-5151	It is I, Aunt Reed.

5152-5152	Who--I?

5154-5154	Who are you?

5156-5156	You are quite a stranger to me--where is Bessie?

5157-5157	She is at the lodge, aunt.

2-2	Aunt,

5159-5160	Who calls me aunt?  You are not one of the Gibsons; and yet I know you--that face, and the eyes and forehead, are quiet familiar to me: you are like--why, you are like Jane Eyre!

2-2	Yet,

5162-5163	I am afraid it is a mistake: my thoughts deceive me.  I wished to see Jane Eyre, and I fancy a likeness where none exists: besides, in eight years she must be so changed.

2-2	I am very ill, I know,

5166-5169	I was trying to turn myself a few minutes since, and find I cannot move a limb.  It is as well I should ease my mind before I die: what we think little of in health, burdens us at such an hour as the present is to me.  Is the nurse here? or is there no one in the room but you?

5171-5171	Well, I have twice done you a wrong which I regret now.  One was in breaking the promise which I gave my husband to bring you up as my own child; the other--

5173-5173	After all, it is of no great importance, perhaps,

5173-5173	and then I may get better; and to humble myself so to her is painful.

5175-5177	Well, I must get it over.  Eternity is before me: I had better tell her.--Go to my dressing-case, open it, and take out a letter you will see there.

5179-5179	Read the letter,

5180-5184	Madam,--Will you have the goodness to send me the address of my    niece, Jane Eyre, and to tell me how she is?  It is my intention to    write shortly and desire her to come to me at Madeira.  Providence has    blessed my endeavours to secure a competency; and as I am unmarried    and childless, I wish to adopt her during my life, and bequeath her at    my death whatever I may have to leave.--I am, Madam, &c., &c.,

5185-5185	JOHN EYRE, Madeira.

5187-5187	Why did I never hear of this?

5189-5193	Because I disliked you too fixedly and thoroughly ever to lend a hand in lifting you to prosperity.  I could not forget your conduct to me, Jane--the fury with which you once turned on me; the tone in which you declared you abhorred me the worst of anybody in the world; the unchildlike look and voice with which you affirmed that the very thought of me made you sick, and asserted that I had treated you with miserable cruelty.  I could not forget my own sensations when you thus started up and poured out the venom of your mind: I felt fear as if an animal that I had struck or pushed had looked up at me with human eyes and cursed me in a man's voice.--Bring me some water!  Oh, make haste!

5194-5194	Dear Mrs. Reed,

5195-5196	think no more of all this, let it pass away from your mind.  Forgive me for my passionate language: I was a child then; eight, nine years have passed since that day.

5197-5200	I tell you I could not forget it; and I took my revenge: for you to be adopted by your uncle, and placed in a state of ease and comfort, was what I could not endure.  I wrote to him; I said I was sorry for his disappointment, but Jane Eyre was dead: she had died of typhus fever at Lowood.  Now act as you please: write and contradict my assertion--expose my falsehood as soon as you like.  You were born, I think, to be my torment: my last hour is racked by the recollection of a deed which, but for you, I should never have been tempted to commit.

2-2	If you could but be persuaded to think no more of it, aunt, and to regard me with kindness and forgiveness

2-2	You have a very bad disposition,

5201-5201	and one to this day I feel it impossible to understand: how for nine years you could be patient and quiescent under any treatment, and in the tenth break out all fire and violence, I can never comprehend.

5202-5203	My disposition is not so bad as you think: I am passionate, but not vindictive.  Many a time, as a little child, I should have been glad to love you if you would have let me; and I long earnestly to be reconciled to you now: kiss me, aunt.

2-2	Love me, then, or hate me, as you will,

5207-5207	you have my full and free forgiveness: ask now for God's, and be at peace.

5221-5221	With her constitution she should have lived to a good old age: her life was shortened by trouble.

5229-5231	If you and I were destined to live always together, cousin, we would commence matters on a different footing.  I should not settle tamely down into being the forbearing party; I should assign you your share of labour, and compel you to accomplish it, or else it should be left undone: I should insist, also, on your keeping some of those drawling, half-insincere complaints hushed in your own breast.  It is only because our connection happens to be very transitory, and comes at a peculiarly mournful season, that I consent thus to render it so patient and compliant on my part.

5236-5236	And,

5236-5237	I am obliged to you for your valuable services and discreet conduct!  There is some difference between living with such an one as you and with Georgiana: you perform your own part in life and burden no one. To-morrow,

5238-5240	I set out for the Continent.  I shall take up my abode in a religious house near Lisle--a nunnery you would call it; there I shall be quiet and unmolested.  I shall devote myself for a time to the examination of the Roman Catholic dogmas, and to a careful study of the workings of their system: if I find it to be, as I half suspect it is, the one best calculated to ensure the doing of all things decently and in order, I shall embrace the tenets of Rome and probably take the veil.

5242-5242	The vocation will fit you to a hair,

5242-5242	much good may it do you!

5243-5243	Good-bye, cousin Jane Eyre; I wish you well: you have some sense.

5244-5245	You are not without sense, cousin Eliza; but what you have, I suppose, in another year will be walled up alive in a French convent.  However, it is not my business, and so it suits you, I don't much care.

2-2	You are in the right,

5259-5259	You would be strangely incredulous if you did doubt it,

5266-5266	I don't doubt it.

5267-5267	Where was I to go?

5276-5276	Mrs. Fairfax will smile you a calm welcome, to be sure,

5277-5277	and little Adele will clap her hands and jump to see you: but you know very well you are thinking of another than they, and that he is not thinking of you.

5281-5283	Hasten! hasten! be with him while you may: but a few more days or weeks, at most, and you are parted from him for ever!

5297-5297	Hillo!

5299-5300	There you are!  Come on, if you please.

5303-5306	And this is Jane Eyre?  Are you coming from Millcote, and on foot? Yes--just one of your tricks: not to send for a carriage, and come clattering over street and road like a common mortal, but to steal into the vicinage of your home along with twilight, just as if you were a dream or a shade.  What the deuce have you done with yourself this last month?

5307-5307	I have been with my aunt, sir, who is dead.

5308-5314	A true Janian reply!  Good angels be my guard!  She comes from the other world--from the abode of people who are dead; and tells me so when she meets me alone here in the gloaming!  If I dared, I'd touch you, to see if you are substance or shadow, you elf!--but I'd as soon offer to take hold of a blue _ignis fatuus_ light in a marsh.  Truant! truant!

5316-5316	Absent from me a whole month, and forgetting me quite, I'll be sworn!

5323-5323	Yes; I suppose you found that out by second-sight.

5324-5325	Mrs. Fairfax told me in a letter.

5326-5326	And did she inform you what I went to do?

5327-5328	Oh, yes, sir!  Everybody knew your errand.

5329-5332	You must see the carriage, Jane, and tell me if you don't think it will suit Mrs. Rochester exactly; and whether she won't look like Queen Boadicea, leaning back against those purple cushions.  I wish, Jane, I were a trifle better adapted to match with her externally.  Tell me now, fairy as you are--can't you give me a charm, or a philter, or something of that sort, to make me a handsome man?

2-2	It would be past the power of magic, sir;

5333-5333	A loving eye is all the charm needed: to such you are handsome enough; or rather your sternness has a power beyond beauty.

2-2	Pass, Janet,

5337-5337	go up home, and stay your weary little wandering feet at a friend's threshold.

5341-5343	Thank you, Mr. Rochester, for your great kindness.  I am strangely glad to get back again to you: and wherever you are is my home--my only home.

5345-5345	bon soir

5351-5351	prete a croquer sa petite maman Anglaise

2-2	Day its fervid fires had wasted,

2-2	Now, he has his back towards me,

5392-5392	and he is occupied too; perhaps, if I walk softly, I can slip away unnoticed.

5394-5394	I shall get by very well,

5395-5395	Jane, come and look at this fellow.

2-2	Look at his wings,

5398-5399	he reminds me rather of a West Indian insect; one does not often see so large and gay a night-rover in England; there! he is flown.

5402-5402	Turn back: on so lovely a night it is a shame to sit in the house; and surely no one can wish to go to bed while sunset is thus at meeting with moonrise.

2-2	Jane,

5407-5407	Thornfield is a pleasant place in summer, is it not?

5408-5408	Yes, sir.

5409-5409	You must have become in some degree attached to the house,--you, who have an eye for natural beauties, and a good deal of the organ of Adhesiveness?

5410-5410	I am attached to it, indeed.

5411-5411	And though I don't comprehend how it is, I perceive you have acquired a degree of regard for that foolish little child Adele, too; and even for simple dame Fairfax?

5412-5412	Yes, sir; in different ways, I have an affection for both.

5413-5413	And would be sorry to part with them?

5414-5414	Yes.

5415-5415	Pity!

5417-5417	It is always the way of events in this life,

5417-5417	no sooner have you got settled in a pleasant resting-place, than a voice calls out to you to rise and move on, for the hour of repose is expired.

5418-5418	Must I move on, sir?

5420-5420	Must I leave Thornfield?

5421-5422	I believe you must, Jane.  I am sorry, Janet, but I believe indeed you must.

5424-5424	Well, sir, I shall be ready when the order to march comes.

5425-5425	It is come now--I must give it to-night.

5426-5426	Then you _are_ going to be married, sir?

5427-5427	Ex-act-ly--pre-cise-ly: with your usual acuteness, you have hit the nail straight on the head.

5428-5428	Soon, sir?

5429-5434	Very soon, my--that is, Miss Eyre: and you'll remember, Jane, the first time I, or Rumour, plainly intimated to you that it was my intention to put my old bachelor's neck into the sacred noose, to enter into the holy estate of matrimony--to take Miss Ingram to my bosom, in short (she's an extensive armful: but that's not to the point--one can't have too much of such a very excellent thing as my beautiful Blanche): well, as I was saying--listen to me, Jane!  You're not turning your head to look after more moths, are you?  That was only a lady-clock, child, 'flying away home.'  I wish to remind you that it was you who first said to me, with that discretion I respect in you--with that foresight, prudence, and humility which befit your responsible and dependent position--that in case I married Miss Ingram, both you and little Adele had better trot forthwith.  I pass over the sort of slur conveyed in this suggestion on the character of my beloved; indeed, when you are far away, Janet, I'll try to forget it: I shall notice only its wisdom; which is such that I have made it my law of action.  Adele must go to school; and you, Miss Eyre, must get a new situation.

2-2	Yes, sir, I will advertise immediately: and meantime, I suppose--

4-4	I suppose I may stay here, till I find another shelter to betake myself to:

2-2	In about a month I hope to be a bridegroom,

5437-5437	and in the interim, I shall myself look out for employment and an asylum for you.

2-2	Thank you, sir; I am sorry to give--

5438-5441	Oh, no need to apologise!  I consider that when a dependent does her duty as well as you have done yours, she has a sort of claim upon her employer for any little assistance he can conveniently render her; indeed I have already, through my future mother-in-law, heard of a place that I think will suit: it is to undertake the education of the five daughters of Mrs. Dionysius O'Gall of Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland.  You'll like Ireland, I think: they're such warm-hearted people there, they say.

5442-5442	It is a long way off, sir.

5443-5443	No matter--a girl of your sense will not object to the voyage or the distance.

2-2	Not the voyage, but the distance: and then the sea is a barrier--

5444-5444	From what, Jane?

2-2	From England and from Thornfield: and--

5445-5445	Well?

5446-5446	From _you_, sir.

2-2	It is a long way,

5452-5454	It is, to be sure; and when you get to Bitternutt Lodge, Connaught, Ireland, I shall never see you again, Jane: that's morally certain.  I never go over to Ireland, not having myself much of a fancy for the country.  We have been good friends, Jane; have we not?

5455-5455	Yes, sir.

5456-5459	And when friends are on the eve of separation, they like to spend the little time that remains to them close to each other.  Come! we'll talk over the voyage and the parting quietly half-an-hour or so, while the stars enter into their shining life up in heaven yonder: here is the chestnut tree: here is the bench at its old roots.  Come, we will sit there in peace to-night, though we should never more be destined to sit there together.

5461-5462	It is a long way to Ireland, Janet, and I am sorry to send my little friend on such weary travels: but if I can't do better, how is it to be helped?  Are you anything akin to me, do you think, Jane?

2-2	Because,

5464-5466	I sometimes have a queer feeling with regard to you--especially when you are near me, as now: it is as if I had a string somewhere under my left ribs, tightly and inextricably knotted to a similar string situated in the corresponding quarter of your little frame.  And if that boisterous Channel, and two hundred miles or so of land come broad between us, I am afraid that cord of communion will be snapt; and then I've a nervous notion I should take to bleeding inwardly. As for you,--you'd forget me.

2-2	That I _never_ should, sir: you know--

5468-5469	Jane, do you hear that nightingale singing in the wood?  Listen!

5472-5472	Because you are sorry to leave it?

5474-5481	I grieve to leave Thornfield: I love Thornfield:--I love it, because I have lived in it a full and delightful life,--momentarily at least.  I have not been trampled on.  I have not been petrified.  I have not been buried with inferior minds, and excluded from every glimpse of communion with what is bright and energetic and high.  I have talked, face to face, with what I reverence, with what I delight in,--with an original, a vigorous, an expanded mind.  I have known you, Mr. Rochester; and it strikes me with terror and anguish to feel I absolutely must be torn from you for ever.  I see the necessity of departure; and it is like looking on the necessity of death.

5482-5482	Where do you see the necessity?

5484-5485	Where?  You, sir, have placed it before me.

5486-5486	In what shape?

5487-5487	In the shape of Miss Ingram; a noble and beautiful woman,--your bride.

5488-5490	My bride!  What bride?  I have no bride!

5491-5491	But you will have.

5492-5493	Yes;--I will!--I will!

5495-5495	Then I must go:--you have said it yourself.

5496-5497	No: you must stay!  I swear it--and the oath shall be kept.

5498-5498	I tell you I must go!

5500-5508	Do you think I can stay to become nothing to you?  Do you think I am an automaton?--a machine without feelings? and can bear to have my morsel of bread snatched from my lips, and my drop of living water dashed from my cup?  Do you think, because I am poor, obscure, plain, and little, I am soulless and heartless?  You think wrong!--I have as much soul as you,--and full as much heart!  And if God had gifted me with some beauty and much wealth, I should have made it as hard for you to leave me, as it is now for me to leave you.  I am not talking to you now through the medium of custom, conventionalities, nor even of mortal flesh;--it is my spirit that addresses your spirit; just as if both had passed through the grave, and we stood at God's feet, equal,--as we are!

5509-5509	As we are!

5511-5511	so,

5512-5512	so, Jane!

2-2	Yes, so, sir,

5513-5514	and yet not so; for you are a married man--or as good as a married man, and wed to one inferior to you--to one with whom you have no sympathy--whom I do not believe you truly love; for I have seen and heard you sneer at her.  I would scorn such a union: therefore I am better than you--let me go!

5515-5516	Where, Jane?  To Ireland?

5517-5518	Yes--to Ireland.  I have spoken my mind, and can go anywhere now.

5519-5519	Jane, be still; don't struggle so, like a wild frantic bird that is rending its own plumage in its desperation.

5520-5520	I am no bird; and no net ensnares me; I am a free human being with an independent will, which I now exert to leave you.

2-2	And your will shall decide your destiny,

5522-5522	I offer you my hand, my heart, and a share of all my possessions.

5523-5523	You play a farce, which I merely laugh at.

5524-5524	I ask you to pass through life at my side--to be my second self, and best earthly companion.

5525-5525	For that fate you have already made your choice, and must abide by it.

5526-5526	Jane, be still a few moments: you are over-excited: I will be still too.

5531-5531	Come to my side, Jane, and let us explain and understand one another.

5532-5532	I will never again come to your side: I am torn away now, and cannot return.

5533-5533	But, Jane, I summon you as my wife: it is you only I intend to marry.

5535-5535	Come, Jane--come hither.

5536-5536	Your bride stands between us.

2-2	My bride is here,

5538-5539	because my equal is here, and my likeness.  Jane, will you marry me?

5541-5541	Do you doubt me, Jane?

5542-5542	Entirely.

5543-5543	You have no faith in me?

5544-5544	Not a whit.

5545-5545	Am I a liar in your eyes?

5547-5555	Little sceptic, you _shall_ be convinced.  What love have I for Miss Ingram?  None: and that you know.  What love has she for me?  None: as I have taken pains to prove: I caused a rumour to reach her that my fortune was not a third of what was supposed, and after that I presented myself to see the result; it was coldness both from her and her mother.  I would not--I could not--marry Miss Ingram.  You--you strange, you almost unearthly thing!--I love as my own flesh.  You--poor and obscure, and small and plain as you are--I entreat to accept me as a husband.

5556-5556	What, me!

5557-5557	me who have not a friend in the world but you--if you are my friend: not a shilling but what you have given me?

5558-5560	You, Jane, I must have you for my own--entirely my own.  Will you be mine?  Say yes, quickly.

5561-5562	Mr. Rochester, let me look at your face: turn to the moonlight.

5563-5563	Why?

5564-5564	Because I want to read your countenance--turn!

5565-5567	There! you will find it scarcely more legible than a crumpled, scratched page.  Read on: only make haste, for I suffer.

5569-5569	Oh, Jane, you torture me!

5571-5571	With that searching and yet faithful and generous look, you torture me!

5572-5573	How can I do that?  If you are true, and your offer real, my only feelings to you must be gratitude and devotion--they cannot torture.

5574-5574	Gratitude!

5575-5576	Jane accept me quickly. Say, Edward--give me my name--Edward--I will marry you.

5577-5579	Are you in earnest?  Do you truly love me?  Do you sincerely wish me to be your wife?

5580-5580	I do; and if an oath is necessary to satisfy you, I swear it.

5581-5581	Then, sir, I will marry you.

5582-5582	Edward--my little wife!

5583-5583	Dear Edward!

2-2	Come to me--come to me entirely now,

5584-5584	Make my happiness--I will make yours.

5585-5585	God pardon me!

5586-5586	and man meddle not with me: I have her, and will hold her.

5587-5588	There is no one to meddle, sir.  I have no kindred to interfere.

2-2	No--that is the best of it,

5591-5591	Are you happy, Jane?

5592-5592	Yes.

5593-5600	It will atone--it will atone.  Have I not found her friendless, and cold, and comfortless?  Will I not guard, and cherish, and solace her?  Is there not love in my heart, and constancy in my resolves?  It will expiate at God's tribunal.  I know my Maker sanctions what I do.  For the world's judgment--I wash my hands thereof.  For man's opinion--I defy it.

2-2	We must go in,

5606-5607	the weather changes.  I could have sat with thee till morning, Jane.

2-2	And so,

5608-5608	could I with you.

2-2	Hasten to take off your wet things,

5619-5619	and before you go, good- night--good-night, my darling!

5621-5621	Explanation will do for another time,

5640-5640	Miss Eyre, will you come to breakfast?

5645-5646	Where are you going?  It is time for lessons.

5647-5648	Mr. Rochester has sent me away to the nursery.

5649-5649	Where is he?

2-2	In there,

2-2	Come and bid me good-morning,

2-2	Jane, you look blooming, and smiling, and pretty,

5654-5657	truly pretty this morning.  Is this my pale, little elf?  Is this my mustard- seed?  This little sunny-faced girl with the dimpled cheek and rosy lips; the satin-smooth hazel hair, and the radiant hazel eyes?

5659-5659	It is Jane Eyre, sir.

2-2	Soon to be Jane Rochester,

5660-5661	in four weeks, Janet; not a day more.  Do you hear that?

5665-5665	You blushed, and now you are white, Jane: what is that for?

5666-5666	Because you gave me a new name--Jane Rochester; and it seems so strange.

5667-5667	Yes, Mrs. Rochester,

5668-5669	young Mrs. Rochester--Fairfax Rochester's girl-bride.

5670-5672	It can never be, sir; it does not sound likely.  Human beings never enjoy complete happiness in this world.  I was not born for a different destiny to the rest of my species: to imagine such a lot befalling me is a fairy tale--a day-dream.

5673-5676	Which I can and will realise.  I shall begin to-day.  This morning I wrote to my banker in London to send me certain jewels he has in his keeping,--heirlooms for the ladies of Thornfield.  In a day or two I hope to pour them into your lap: for every privilege, every attention shall be yours that I would accord a peer's daughter, if about to marry her.

5677-5680	Oh, sir!--never rain jewels!  I don't like to hear them spoken of. Jewels for Jane Eyre sounds unnatural and strange: I would rather not have them.

5681-5681	I will myself put the diamond chain round your neck, and the circlet on your forehead,--which it will become: for nature, at least, has stamped her patent of nobility on this brow, Jane; and I will clasp the bracelets on these fine wrists, and load these fairy-like fingers with rings.

5682-5684	No, no, sir! think of other subjects, and speak of other things, and in another strain.  Don't address me as if I were a beauty; I am your plain, Quakerish governess.

5685-5685	You are a beauty in my eyes, and a beauty just after the desire of my heart,--delicate and aerial.

5686-5688	Puny and insignificant, you mean.  You are dreaming, sir,--or you are sneering.  For God's sake don't be ironical!

2-2	I will make the world acknowledge you a beauty, too,

5690-5690	I will attire my Jane in satin and lace, and she shall have roses in her hair; and I will cover the head I love best with a priceless veil.

5691-5694	And then you won't know me, sir; and I shall not be your Jane Eyre any longer, but an ape in a harlequin's jacket--a jay in borrowed plumes.  I would as soon see you, Mr. Rochester, tricked out in stage-trappings, as myself clad in a court-lady's robe; and I don't call you handsome, sir, though I love you most dearly: far too dearly to flatter you.  Don't flatter me.

5696-5699	This very day I shall take you in the carriage to Millcote, and you must choose some dresses for yourself.  I told you we shall be married in four weeks.  The wedding is to take place quietly, in the church down below yonder; and then I shall waft you away at once to town.  After a brief stay there, I shall bear my treasure to regions nearer the sun: to French vineyards and Italian plains; and she shall see whatever is famous in old story and in modern record: she shall taste, too, of the life of cities; and she shall learn to value herself by just comparison with others.

5700-5701	Shall I travel?--and with you, sir?

5702-5703	You shall sojourn at Paris, Rome, and Naples: at Florence, Venice, and Vienna: all the ground I have wandered over shall be re-trodden by you: wherever I stamped my hoof, your sylph's foot shall step also.  Ten years since, I flew through Europe half mad; with disgust, hate, and rage as my companions: now I shall revisit it healed and cleansed, with a very angel as my comforter.

5705-5705	I am not an angel,

5705-5707	and I will not be one till I die: I will be myself.  Mr. Rochester, you must neither expect nor exact anything celestial of me--for you will not get it, any more than I shall get it of you: which I do not at all anticipate.

5708-5708	What do you anticipate of me?

5709-5712	For a little while you will perhaps be as you are now,--a very little while; and then you will turn cool; and then you will be capricious; and then you will be stern, and I shall have much ado to please you: but when you get well used to me, you will perhaps like me again,--_like_ me, I say, not _love_ me.  I suppose your love will effervesce in six months, or less.  I have observed in books written by men, that period assigned as the farthest to which a husband's ardour extends.  Yet, after all, as a friend and companion, I hope never to become quite distasteful to my dear master.

5713-5715	Distasteful! and like you again!  I think I shall like you again, and yet again: and I will make you confess I do not only _like_, but _love_ you--with truth, fervour, constancy.

5716-5716	Yet are you not capricious, sir?

5717-5717	To women who please me only by their faces, I am the very devil when I find out they have neither souls nor hearts--when they open to me a perspective of flatness, triviality, and perhaps imbecility, coarseness, and ill-temper: but to the clear eye and eloquent tongue, to the soul made of fire, and the character that bends but does not break--at once supple and stable, tractable and consistent--I am ever tender and true.

5718-5719	Had you ever experience of such a character, sir?  Did you ever love such an one?

5720-5720	I love it now.

5721-5721	But before me: if I, indeed, in any respect come up to your difficult standard?

5722-5726	I never met your likeness.  Jane, you please me, and you master me--you seem to submit, and I like the sense of pliancy you impart; and while I am twining the soft, silken skein round my finger, it sends a thrill up my arm to my heart.  I am influenced--conquered; and the influence is sweeter than I can express; and the conquest I undergo has a witchery beyond any triumph I can win.  Why do you smile, Jane?  What does that inexplicable, that uncanny turn of countenance mean?

2-2	I was thinking, sir (you will excuse the idea; it was involuntary), I was thinking of Hercules and Samson with their charmers--

2-2	You were, you little elfish--

5727-5730	Hush, sir!  You don't talk very wisely just now; any more than those gentlemen acted very wisely.  However, had they been married, they would no doubt by their severity as husbands have made up for their softness as suitors; and so will you, I fear.  I wonder how you will answer me a year hence, should I ask a favour it does not suit your convenience or pleasure to grant.

2-2	Ask me something now, Jane,--the least thing: I desire to be entreated--

5731-5731	Indeed I will, sir; I have my petition all ready.

5732-5733	Speak!  But if you look up and smile with that countenance, I shall swear concession before I know to what, and that will make a fool of me.

5734-5734	Not at all, sir; I ask only this: don't send for the jewels, and don't crown me with roses: you might as well put a border of gold lace round that plain pocket handkerchief you have there.

5735-5738	I might as well 'gild refined gold.'  I know it: your request is granted then--for the time.  I will remand the order I despatched to my banker. But you have not yet asked for anything; you have prayed a gift to be withdrawn: try again.

5739-5739	Well then, sir, have the goodness to gratify my curiosity, which is much piqued on one point.

5741-5742	What? what?

5744-5744	Curiosity is a dangerous petition: it is well I have not taken a vow to accord every request--

5744-5744	But there can be no danger in complying with this, sir.

5745-5745	Utter it, Jane: but I wish that instead of a mere inquiry into, perhaps, a secret, it was a wish for half my estate.

5746-5750	Now, King Ahasuerus!  What do I want with half your estate?  Do you think I am a Jew-usurer, seeking good investment in land?  I would much rather have all your confidence.  You will not exclude me from your confidence if you admit me to your heart?

5751-5752	You are welcome to all my confidence that is worth having, Jane; but for God's sake, don't desire a useless burden!  Don't long for poison--don't turn out a downright Eve on my hands!

5753-5755	Why not, sir?  You have just been telling me how much you liked to be conquered, and how pleasant over-persuasion is to you.  Don't you think I had better take advantage of the confession, and begin and coax and entreat--even cry and be sulky if necessary--for the sake of a mere essay of my power?

5756-5757	I dare you to any such experiment.  Encroach, presume, and the game is up.

5758-5762	Is it, sir?  You soon give in.  How stern you look now!  Your eyebrows have become as thick as my finger, and your forehead resembles what, in some very astonishing poetry, I once saw styled, 'a blue-piled thunderloft.'  That will be your married look, sir, I suppose?

5763-5764	If that will be _your_ married look, I, as a Christian, will soon give up the notion of consorting with a mere sprite or salamander.  But what had you to ask, thing,--out with it?

5765-5767	There, you are less than civil now; and I like rudeness a great deal better than flattery.  I had rather be a _thing_ than an angel.  This is what I have to ask,--Why did you take such pains to make me believe you wished to marry Miss Ingram?

5768-5769	Is that all?  Thank God it is no worse!

5771-5771	I think I may confess,

5771-5773	even although I should make you a little indignant, Jane--and I have seen what a fire-spirit you can be when you are indignant.  You glowed in the cool moonlight last night, when you mutinied against fate, and claimed your rank as my equal.  Janet, by-the-bye, it was you who made me the offer.

5774-5775	Of course I did.  But to the point if you please, sir--Miss Ingram?

5776-5776	Well, I feigned courtship of Miss Ingram, because I wished to render you as madly in love with me as I was with you; and I knew jealousy would be the best ally I could call in for the furtherance of that end.

5777-5780	Excellent!  Now you are small--not one whit bigger than the end of my little finger.  It was a burning shame and a scandalous disgrace to act in that way.  Did you think nothing of Miss Ingram's feelings, sir?

5781-5782	Her feelings are concentrated in one--pride; and that needs humbling. Were you jealous, Jane?

5783-5787	Never mind, Mr. Rochester: it is in no way interesting to you to know that.  Answer me truly once more.  Do you think Miss Ingram will not suffer from your dishonest coquetry?  Won't she feel forsaken and deserted?

5788-5789	Impossible!--when I told you how she, on the contrary, deserted me: the idea of my insolvency cooled, or rather extinguished, her flame in a moment.

5790-5792	You have a curious, designing mind, Mr. Rochester.  I am afraid your principles on some points are eccentric.

5793-5793	My principles were never trained, Jane: they may have grown a little awry for want of attention.

5794-5794	Once again, seriously; may I enjoy the great good that has been vouchsafed to me, without fearing that any one else is suffering the bitter pain I myself felt a while ago?

5795-5795	That you may, my good little girl: there is not another being in the world has the same pure love for me as yourself--for I lay that pleasant unction to my soul, Jane, a belief in your affection.

2-2	Ask something more,

5798-5798	it is my delight to be entreated, and to yield.

5800-5803	Communicate your intentions to Mrs. Fairfax, sir: she saw me with you last night in the hall, and she was shocked.  Give her some explanation before I see her again.  It pains me to be misjudged by so good a woman.

2-2	Go to your room, and put on your bonnet,

5805-5806	I mean you to accompany me to Millcote this morning; and while you prepare for the drive, I will enlighten the old lady's understanding.  Did she think, Janet, you had given the world for love, and considered it well lost?

5807-5807	I believe she thought I had forgotten my station, and yours, sir.

5808-5811	Station! station!--your station is in my heart, and on the necks of those who would insult you, now or hereafter.--Go.

2-2	I feel so astonished,

5820-5827	I hardly know what to say to you, Miss Eyre.  I have surely not been dreaming, have I?  Sometimes I half fall asleep when I am sitting alone and fancy things that have never happened.  It has seemed to me more than once when I have been in a doze, that my dear husband, who died fifteen years since, has come in and sat down beside me; and that I have even heard him call me by my name, Alice, as he used to do.  Now, can you tell me whether it is actually true that Mr. Rochester has asked you to marry him?  Don't laugh at me.  But I really thought he came in here five minutes ago, and said that in a month you would be his wife.

2-2	He has said the same thing to me,

5829-5831	He has!  Do you believe him?  Have you accepted him?

5832-5832	Yes.

5834-5837	I could never have thought it.  He is a proud man: all the Rochesters were proud: and his father, at least, liked money.  He, too, has always been called careful.  He means to marry you?

5838-5838	He tells me so.

5840-5840	It passes me!

5841-5844	but no doubt, it is true since you say so.  How it will answer, I cannot tell: I really don't know.  Equality of position and fortune is often advisable in such cases; and there are twenty years of difference in your ages.  He might almost be your father.

5845-5846	No, indeed, Mrs. Fairfax!

5847-5850	he is nothing like my father!  No one, who saw us together, would suppose it for an instant. Mr. Rochester looks as young, and is as young, as some men at five-and- twenty.

5851-5851	Is it really for love he is going to marry you?

2-2	I am sorry to grieve you,

5854-5855	but you are so young, and so little acquainted with men, I wished to put you on your guard.  It is an old saying that 'all is not gold that glitters;' and in this case I do fear there will be something found to be different to what either you or I expect.

5856-5857	Why?--am I a monster?

5858-5859	is it impossible that Mr. Rochester should have a sincere affection for me?

5860-5865	No: you are very well; and much improved of late; and Mr. Rochester, I daresay, is fond of you.  I have always noticed that you were a sort of pet of his.  There are times when, for your sake, I have been a little uneasy at his marked preference, and have wished to put you on your guard: but I did not like to suggest even the possibility of wrong.  I knew such an idea would shock, perhaps offend you; and you were so discreet, and so thoroughly modest and sensible, I hoped you might be trusted to protect yourself.  Last night I cannot tell you what I suffered when I sought all over the house, and could find you nowhere, nor the master either; and then, at twelve o'clock, saw you come in with him.

2-2	Well, never mind that now,

5866-5866	it is enough that all was right.

2-2	I hope all will be right in the end,

5867-5870	but believe me, you cannot be too careful.  Try and keep Mr. Rochester at a distance: distrust yourself as well as him.  Gentlemen in his station are not accustomed to marry their governesses.

5872-5872	Let me go,--let me go to Millcote too!

5874-5876	Mr. Rochester won't: though there is so much room in the new carriage.  Beg him to let me go mademoiselle.

2-2	That I will, Adele;

5879-5879	Adele may accompany us, may she not, sir?

5880-5882	I told her no.  I'll have no brats!--I'll have only you.

5883-5884	Do let her go, Mr. Rochester, if you please: it would be better.

5885-5885	Not it: she will be a restraint.

5891-5891	What is the matter?

5892-5894	all the sunshine is gone.  Do you really wish the bairn to go?  Will it annoy you if she is left behind?

5895-5895	I would far rather she went, sir.

5896-5896	Then off for your bonnet, and back like a flash of lightning!

2-2	After all, a single morning's interruption will not matter much,

5899-5899	when I mean shortly to claim you--your thoughts, conversation, and company--for life.

2-2	Let her come to me,

5902-5902	she will, perhaps, trouble you, sir: there is plenty of room on this side.

5904-5904	I'll send her to school yet,

5905-5905	sans mademoiselle?

2-2	Yes,

5906-5906	absolutely sans mademoiselle; for I am to take mademoiselle to the moon, and there I shall seek a cave in one of the white valleys among the volcano-tops, and mademoiselle shall live with me there, and only me.

2-2	She will have nothing to eat: you will starve her,

5908-5908	I shall gather manna for her morning and night: the plains and hillsides in the moon are bleached with manna, Adele.

5909-5909	She will want to warm herself: what will she do for a fire?

5910-5910	Fire rises out of the lunar mountains: when she is cold, I'll carry her up to a peak, and lay her down on the edge of a crater.

5911-5912	Oh, qu' elle y sera mal--peu comfortable!  And her clothes, they will wear out: how can she get new ones?

5915-5915	Hem!

5917-5920	What would you do, Adele?  Cudgel your brains for an expedient.  How would a white or a pink cloud answer for a gown, do you think?  And one could cut a pretty enough scarf out of a rainbow.

2-2	She is far better as she is,

5921-5922	besides, she would get tired of living with only you in the moon.  If I were mademoiselle, I would never consent to go with you.

5923-5923	She has consented: she has pledged her word.

5924-5924	But you can't get her there; there is no road to the moon: it is all air; and neither you nor she can fly.

5925-5925	Adele, look at that field.

5927-5930	In that field, Adele, I was walking late one evening about a fortnight since--the evening of the day you helped me to make hay in the orchard meadows; and, as I was tired with raking swaths, I sat down to rest me on a stile; and there I took out a little book and a pencil, and began to write about a misfortune that befell me long ago, and a wish I had for happy days to come: I was writing away very fast, though daylight was fading from the leaf, when something came up the path and stopped two yards off me.  I looked at it.  It was a little thing with a veil of gossamer on its head.  I beckoned it to come near me; it stood soon at my knee.  I never spoke to it, and it never spoke to me, in words; but I read its eyes, and it read mine; and our speechless colloquy was to this effect--

5931-5932	It was a fairy, and come from Elf-land, it said; and its errand was to make me happy: I must go with it out of the common world to a lonely place--such as the moon, for instance--and it nodded its head towards her horn, rising over Hay-hill: it told me of the alabaster cave and silver vale where we might live.  I said I should like to go; but reminded it, as you did me, that I had no wings to fly.

5933-5937	'Oh,' returned the fairy, 'that does not signify!  Here is a talisman will remove all difficulties;' and she held out a pretty gold ring.  'Put it,' she said, 'on the fourth finger of my left hand, and I am yours, and you are mine; and we shall leave earth, and make our own heaven yonder.' She nodded again at the moon.  The ring, Adele, is in my breeches-pocket, under the disguise of a sovereign: but I mean soon to change it to a ring again.

5938-5939	But what has mademoiselle to do with it?  I don't care for the fairy: you said it was mademoiselle you would take to the moon?

2-2	Mademoiselle is a fairy,

5941-5941	un vrai menteur,

5943-5943	contes de fee,

5945-5945	du reste, il n'y avait pas de fees, et quand meme il y en avait:

5944-5944	It might pass for the present,

5951-5951	but he would yet see me glittering like a parterre.

5953-5953	It would, indeed, be a relief,

5955-5958	if I had ever so small an independency; I never can bear being dressed like a doll by Mr. Rochester, or sitting like a second Danae with the golden shower falling daily round me.  I will write to Madeira the moment I get home, and tell my uncle John I am going to be married, and to whom: if I had but a prospect of one day bringing Mr. Rochester an accession of fortune, I could better endure to be kept by him now.

2-2	You need not look in that way,

5961-5962	if you do, I'll wear nothing but my old Lowood frocks to the end of the chapter.  I'll be married in this lilac gingham: you may make a dressing-gown for yourself out of the pearl-grey silk, and an infinite series of waistcoats out of the black satin.

5964-5964	Oh, it is rich to see and hear her?

5966-5968	Is she original?  Is she piquant?  I would not exchange this one little English girl for the Grand Turk's whole seraglio, gazelle- eyes, houri forms, and all!

5970-5970	I'll not stand you an inch in the stead of a seraglio,

5970-5971	so don't consider me an equivalent for one.  If you have a fancy for anything in that line, away with you, sir, to the bazaars of Stamboul without delay, and lay out in extensive slave- purchases some of that spare cash you seem at a loss to spend satisfactorily here.

5972-5972	And what will you do, Janet, while I am bargaining for so many tons of flesh and such an assortment of black eyes?

5973-5974	I'll be preparing myself to go out as a missionary to preach liberty to them that are enslaved--your harem inmates amongst the rest.  I'll get admitted there, and I'll stir up mutiny; and you, three-tailed bashaw as you are, sir, shall in a trice find yourself fettered amongst our hands: nor will I, for one, consent to cut your bonds till you have signed a charter, the most liberal that despot ever yet conferred.

5975-5975	I would consent to be at your mercy, Jane.

5976-5978	I would have no mercy, Mr. Rochester, if you supplicated for it with an eye like that.  While you looked so, I should be certain that whatever charter you might grant under coercion, your first act, when released, would be to violate its conditions.

5979-5981	Why, Jane, what would you have?  I fear you will compel me to go through a private marriage ceremony, besides that performed at the altar.  You will stipulate, I see, for peculiar terms--what will they be?

5982-5986	I only want an easy mind, sir; not crushed by crowded obligations.  Do you remember what you said of Celine Varens?--of the diamonds, the cashmeres you gave her?  I will not be your English Celine Varens.  I shall continue to act as Adele's governess; by that I shall earn my board and lodging, and thirty pounds a year besides.  I'll furnish my own wardrobe out of that money, and you shall give me nothing but--

5987-5987	Well, but what?

5988-5988	Your regard; and if I give you mine in return, that debt will be quit.

2-2	Well, for cool native impudence and pure innate pride, you haven't your equal,

5991-5991	Will it please you to dine with me to-day?

5993-5993	No, thank you, sir.

5994-5995	And what for, 'no, thank you?' if one may inquire.

2-2	I never have dined with you, sir: and I see no reason why I should now: till--

5996-5997	Till what?  You delight in half-phrases.

5998-5998	Till I can't help it.

5999-5999	Do you suppose I eat like an ogre or a ghoul, that you dread being the companion of my repast?

6000-6000	I have formed no supposition on the subject, sir; but I want to go on as usual for another month.

6001-6001	You will give up your governessing slavery at once.

6002-6004	Indeed, begging your pardon, sir, I shall not.  I shall just go on with it as usual.  I shall keep out of your way all day, as I have been accustomed to do: you may send for me in the evening, when you feel disposed to see me, and I'll come then; but at no other time.

6005-6006	I want a smoke, Jane, or a pinch of snuff, to comfort me under all this, 'pour me donner une contenance,' as Adele would say; and unfortunately I have neither my cigar-case, nor my snuff-box.  But listen--whisper.  It is your time now, little tyrant, but it will be mine presently; and when once I have fairly seized you, to have and to hold, I'll just--figuratively speaking--attach you to a chain like this

6008-6008	Yes, bonny wee thing, I'll wear you in my bosom, lest my jewel I should tyne.

6016-6016	Did I like his voice?

6018-6018	Very much.

6020-6020	Then, Jane, you must play the accompaniment.

6021-6021	Very well, sir, I will try.

6022-6022	a little bungler.

6025-6025	The truest love that ever heart       Felt at its kindled core,    Did through each vein, in quickened start,       The tide of being pour.

6036-6036	

6039-6039	whom he was going to marry now?

6040-6040	That was a strange question to be put by his darling Jane.

6041-6044	Indeed!  I considered it a very natural and necessary one: he had talked of his future wife dying with him.  What did he mean by such a pagan idea?  _I_ had no intention of dying with him--he might depend on that.

6045-6046	Oh, all he longed, all he prayed for, was that I might live with him! Death was not for such as I.

6047-6047	Indeed it was: I had as good a right to die when my time came as he had: but I should bide that time, and not be hurried away in a suttee.

6048-6048	Would I forgive him for the selfish idea, and prove my pardon by a reconciling kiss?

6049-6049	No: I would rather be excused.

2-2	hard little thing;

6050-6050	any other woman would have been melted to marrow at hearing such stanzas crooned in her praise.

6052-6052	Would I be quiet and talk rationally?

6053-6053	I would be quiet if he liked, and as to talking rationally, I flattered myself I was doing that now.

6055-6055	Very good,

6055-6056	you may fume and fidget as you please: but this is the best plan to pursue with you, I am certain.  I like you more than I can say; but I'll not sink into a bathos of sentiment: and with this needle of repartee I'll keep you from the edge of the gulf too; and, moreover, maintain by its pungent aid that distance between you and myself most conducive to our real mutual advantage.

2-2	I wish you good-night, sir,

6061-6061	love

6063-6063	darling

6065-6065	provoking puppet,

6067-6067	malicious elf,

6069-6069	sprite,

6071-6071	changeling,

6062-6062	I can keep you in reasonable check now,

6069-6069	and I don't doubt to be able to do it hereafter: if one expedient loses its virtue, another must be devised.

6081-6081	Mrs. Rochester, --- Hotel, London,

6083-6083	I will leave you by yourself, white dream,

6091-6091	I am feverish: I hear the wind blowing: I will go out of doors and feel it.

2-2	You did right to hold fast to each other,

6105-6105	I think, scathed as you look, and charred and scorched, there must be a little sense of life in you yet, rising out of that adhesion at the faithful, honest roots: you will never have green leaves more--never more see birds making nests and singing idyls in your boughs; the time of pleasure and love is over with you: but you are not desolate: each of you has a comrade to sympathise with him in his decay.

6113-6113	How late it grows!

6115-6116	I will run down to the gates: it is moonlight at intervals; I can see a good way on the road.  He may be coming now, and to meet him will save some minutes of suspense.

6120-6121	I wish he would come!  I wish he would come!

2-2	Well, I cannot return to the house,

6128-6128	I cannot sit by the fireside, while he is abroad in inclement weather: better tire my limbs than strain my heart; I will go forward and meet him.

6134-6134	There!

6135-6136	You can't do without me, that is evident.  Step on my boot-toe; give me both hands: mount!

6139-6140	But is there anything the matter, Janet, that you come to meet me at such an hour?  Is there anything wrong?

6141-6142	No, but I thought you would never come.  I could not bear to wait in the house for you, especially with this rain and wind.

6143-6145	Rain and wind, indeed!  Yes, you are dripping like a mermaid; pull my cloak round you: but I think you are feverish, Jane: both your cheek and hand are burning hot.  I ask again, is there anything the matter?

6146-6146	Nothing now; I am neither afraid nor unhappy.

6147-6147	Then you have been both?

6148-6148	Rather: but I'll tell you all about it by-and-bye, sir; and I daresay you will only laugh at me for my pains.

6149-6152	I'll laugh at you heartily when to-morrow is past; till then I dare not: my prize is not certain.  This is you, who have been as slippery as an eel this last month, and as thorny as a briar-rose?  I could not lay a finger anywhere but I was pricked; and now I seem to have gathered up a stray lamb in my arms.  You wandered out of the fold to seek your shepherd, did you, Jane?

6153-6154	I wanted you: but don't boast.  Here we are at Thornfield: now let me get down.

6158-6158	Take a seat and bear me company, Jane: please God, it is the last meal but one you will eat at Thornfield Hall for a long time.

6160-6161	Is it because you have the prospect of a journey before you, Jane?  Is it the thoughts of going to London that takes away your appetite?

6162-6163	I cannot see my prospects clearly to-night, sir; and I hardly know what thoughts I have in my head.  Everything in life seems unreal.

6164-6164	Except me: I am substantial enough--touch me.

6165-6165	You, sir, are the most phantom-like of all: you are a mere dream.

6167-6167	Is that a dream?

2-2	Yes; though I touch it, it is a dream,

6171-6171	Sir, have you finished supper?

6172-6172	Yes, Jane.

2-2	It is near midnight,

6176-6176	Yes: but remember, Jane, you promised to wake with me the night before my wedding.

6177-6177	I did; and I will keep my promise, for an hour or two at least: I have no wish to go to bed.

6178-6178	Are all your arrangements complete?

6179-6179	All, sir.

2-2	And on my part likewise,

6180-6180	I have settled everything; and we shall leave Thornfield to-morrow, within half-an-hour after our return from church.

6181-6181	Very well, sir.

6182-6185	With what an extraordinary smile you uttered that word--'very well,' Jane!  What a bright spot of colour you have on each cheek! and how strangely your eyes glitter!  Are you well?

6186-6186	I believe I am.

6187-6189	Believe!  What is the matter?  Tell me what you feel.

6190-6191	I could not, sir: no words could tell you what I feel.  I wish this present hour would never end: who knows with what fate the next may come charged?

6192-6193	This is hypochondria, Jane.  You have been over-excited, or over-fatigued.

6194-6194	Do you, sir, feel calm and happy?

6195-6196	Calm?--no: but happy--to the heart's core.

2-2	Give me your confidence, Jane,

6198-6200	relieve your mind of any weight that oppresses it, by imparting it to me.  What do you fear?--that I shall not prove a good husband?

6201-6201	It is the idea farthest from my thoughts.

6202-6203	Are you apprehensive of the new sphere you are about to enter?--of the new life into which you are passing?

6204-6204	No.

6205-6206	You puzzle me, Jane: your look and tone of sorrowful audacity perplex and pain me.  I want an explanation.

6207-6208	Then, sir, listen.  You were from home last night?

6209-6214	I was: I know that; and you hinted a while ago at something which had happened in my absence:--nothing, probably, of consequence; but, in short, it has disturbed you.  Let me hear it.  Mrs. Fairfax has said something, perhaps? or you have overheard the servants talk?--your sensitive self-respect has been wounded?

6215-6215	No, sir.

6217-6226	All day yesterday I was very busy, and very happy in my ceaseless bustle; for I am not, as you seem to think, troubled by any haunting fears about the new sphere, et cetera: I think it a glorious thing to have the hope of living with you, because I love you.  No, sir, don't caress me now--let me talk undisturbed.  Yesterday I trusted well in Providence, and believed that events were working together for your good and mine: it was a fine day, if you recollect--the calmness of the air and sky forbade apprehensions respecting your safety or comfort on your journey.  I walked a little while on the pavement after tea, thinking of you; and I beheld you in imagination so near me, I scarcely missed your actual presence.  I thought of the life that lay before me--_your_ life, sir--an existence more expansive and stirring than my own: as much more so as the depths of the sea to which the brook runs are than the shallows of its own strait channel.  I wondered why moralists call this world a dreary wilderness: for me it blossomed like a rose.  Just at sunset, the air turned cold and the sky cloudy: I went in, Sophie called me upstairs to look at my wedding-dress, which they had just brought; and under it in the box I found your present--the veil which, in your princely extravagance, you sent for from London: resolved, I suppose, since I would not have jewels, to cheat me into accepting something as costly.  I smiled as I unfolded it, and devised how I would tease you about your aristocratic tastes, and your efforts to masque your plebeian bride in the attributes of a peeress.  I thought how I would carry down to you the square of unembroidered blond I had myself prepared as a covering for my low-born head, and ask if that was not good enough for a woman who could bring her husband neither fortune, beauty, nor connections.  I saw plainly how you would look; and heard your impetuous republican answers, and your haughty disavowal of any necessity on your part to augment your wealth, or elevate your standing, by marrying either a purse or a coronet.

6227-6227	How well you read me, you witch!

6229-6230	but what did you find in the veil besides its embroidery?  Did you find poison, or a dagger, that you look so mournful now?

6231-6241	No, no, sir; besides the delicacy and richness of the fabric, I found nothing save Fairfax Rochester's pride; and that did not scare me, because I am used to the sight of the demon.  But, sir, as it grew dark, the wind rose: it blew yesterday evening, not as it blows now--wild and high--but 'with a sullen, moaning sound' far more eerie.  I wished you were at home.  I came into this room, and the sight of the empty chair and fireless hearth chilled me.  For some time after I went to bed, I could not sleep--a sense of anxious excitement distressed me.  The gale still rising, seemed to my ear to muffle a mournful under-sound; whether in the house or abroad I could not at first tell, but it recurred, doubtful yet doleful at every lull; at last I made out it must be some dog howling at a distance.  I was glad when it ceased.  On sleeping, I continued in dreams the idea of a dark and gusty night.  I continued also the wish to be with you, and experienced a strange, regretful consciousness of some barrier dividing us.  During all my first sleep, I was following the windings of an unknown road; total obscurity environed me; rain pelted me; I was burdened with the charge of a little child: a very small creature, too young and feeble to walk, and which shivered in my cold arms, and wailed piteously in my ear.  I thought, sir, that you were on the road a long way before me; and I strained every nerve to overtake you, and made effort on effort to utter your name and entreat you to stop--but my movements were fettered, and my voice still died away inarticulate; while you, I felt, withdrew farther and farther every moment.

6242-6249	And these dreams weigh on your spirits now, Jane, when I am close to you?  Little nervous subject!  Forget visionary woe, and think only of real happiness!  You say you love me, Janet: yes--I will not forget that; and you cannot deny it.  _Those_ words did not die inarticulate on your lips.  I heard them clear and soft: a thought too solemn perhaps, but sweet as music--'I think it is a glorious thing to have the hope of living with you, Edward, because I love you.'  Do you love me, Jane?--repeat it.

6250-6250	I do, sir--I do, with my whole heart.

2-2	Well,

6251-6254	it is strange; but that sentence has penetrated my breast painfully.  Why?  I think because you said it with such an earnest, religious energy, and because your upward gaze at me now is the very sublime of faith, truth, and devotion: it is too much as if some spirit were near me.  Look wicked, Jane: as you know well how to look: coin one of your wild, shy, provoking smiles; tell me you hate me--tease me, vex me; do anything but move me: I would rather be incensed than saddened.

6255-6255	I will tease you and vex you to your heart's content, when I have finished my tale: but hear me to the end.

6256-6257	I thought, Jane, you had told me all.  I thought I had found the source of your melancholy in a dream.

6259-6263	What! is there more?  But I will not believe it to be anything important.  I warn you of incredulity beforehand.  Go on.

6265-6273	I dreamt another dream, sir: that Thornfield Hall was a dreary ruin, the retreat of bats and owls.  I thought that of all the stately front nothing remained but a shell-like wall, very high and very fragile-looking.  I wandered, on a moonlight night, through the grass- grown enclosure within: here I stumbled over a marble hearth, and there over a fallen fragment of cornice.  Wrapped up in a shawl, I still carried the unknown little child: I might not lay it down anywhere, however tired were my arms--however much its weight impeded my progress, I must retain it.  I heard the gallop of a horse at a distance on the road; I was sure it was you; and you were departing for many years and for a distant country.  I climbed the thin wall with frantic perilous haste, eager to catch one glimpse of you from the top: the stones rolled from under my feet, the ivy branches I grasped gave way, the child clung round my neck in terror, and almost strangled me; at last I gained the summit.  I saw you like a speck on a white track, lessening every moment. The blast blew so strong I could not stand.  I sat down on the narrow ledge; I hushed the scared infant in my lap: you turned an angle of the road: I bent forward to take a last look; the wall crumbled; I was shaken; the child rolled from my knee, I lost my balance, fell, and woke.

6274-6274	Now, Jane, that is all.

6275-6288	All the preface, sir; the tale is yet to come.  On waking, a gleam dazzled my eyes; I thought--Oh, it is daylight!  But I was mistaken; it was only candlelight.  Sophie, I supposed, had come in.  There was a light in the dressing-table, and the door of the closet, where, before going to bed, I had hung my wedding-dress and veil, stood open; I heard a rustling there.  I asked, 'Sophie, what are you doing?'  No one answered; but a form emerged from the closet; it took the light, held it aloft, and surveyed the garments pendent from the portmanteau.  'Sophie!  Sophie!'  I again cried: and still it was silent.  I had risen up in bed, I bent forward: first surprise, then bewilderment, came over me; and then my blood crept cold through my veins.  Mr. Rochester, this was not Sophie, it was not Leah, it was not Mrs. Fairfax: it was not--no, I was sure of it, and am still--it was not even that strange woman, Grace Poole.

2-2	It must have been one of them,

6290-6291	No, sir, I solemnly assure you to the contrary.  The shape standing before me had never crossed my eyes within the precincts of Thornfield Hall before; the height, the contour were new to me.

6292-6292	Describe it, Jane.

6293-6294	It seemed, sir, a woman, tall and large, with thick and dark hair hanging long down her back.  I know not what dress she had on: it was white and straight; but whether gown, sheet, or shroud, I cannot tell.

6295-6295	Did you see her face?

6296-6298	Not at first.  But presently she took my veil from its place; she held it up, gazed at it long, and then she threw it over her own head, and turned to the mirror.  At that moment I saw the reflection of the visage and features quite distinctly in the dark oblong glass.

6299-6299	And how were they?

6300-6302	Fearful and ghastly to me--oh, sir, I never saw a face like it!  It was a discoloured face--it was a savage face.  I wish I could forget the roll of the red eyes and the fearful blackened inflation of the lineaments!

6303-6303	Ghosts are usually pale, Jane.

6304-6305	This, sir, was purple: the lips were swelled and dark; the brow furrowed: the black eyebrows widely raised over the bloodshot eyes.  Shall I tell you of what it reminded me?

6306-6306	You may.

6307-6307	Of the foul German spectre--the Vampyre.

6308-6309	Ah!--what did it do?

6310-6310	Sir, it removed my veil from its gaunt head, rent it in two parts, and flinging both on the floor, trampled on them.

6312-6312	Afterwards?

6313-6315	It drew aside the window-curtain and looked out; perhaps it saw dawn approaching, for, taking the candle, it retreated to the door.  Just at my bedside, the figure stopped: the fiery eyes glared upon me--she thrust up her candle close to my face, and extinguished it under my eyes.  I was aware her lurid visage flamed over mine, and I lost consciousness: for the second time in my life--only the second time--I became insensible from terror.

6316-6316	Who was with you when you revived?

6317-6319	No one, sir, but the broad day.  I rose, bathed my head and face in water, drank a long draught; felt that though enfeebled I was not ill, and determined that to none but you would I impart this vision.  Now, sir, tell me who and what that woman was?

6320-6321	The creature of an over-stimulated brain; that is certain.  I must be careful of you, my treasure: nerves like yours were not made for rough handling.

6322-6322	Sir, depend on it, my nerves were not in fault; the thing was real: the transaction actually took place.

6323-6326	And your previous dreams, were they real too?  Is Thornfield Hall a ruin?  Am I severed from you by insuperable obstacles?  Am I leaving you without a tear--without a kiss--without a word?

6327-6327	Not yet.

6328-6329	Am I about to do it?  Why, the day is already commenced which is to bind us indissolubly; and when we are once united, there shall be no recurrence of these mental terrors: I guarantee that.

6330-6331	Mental terrors, sir!  I wish I could believe them to be only such: I wish it more now than ever; since even you cannot explain to me the mystery of that awful visitant.

6332-6332	And since I cannot do it, Jane, it must have been unreal.

6333-6333	But, sir, when I said so to myself on rising this morning, and when I looked round the room to gather courage and comfort from the cheerful aspect of each familiar object in full daylight, there--on the carpet--I saw what gave the distinct lie to my hypothesis,--the veil, torn from top to bottom in two halves!

6336-6336	Thank God!

6337-6338	that if anything malignant did come near you last night, it was only the veil that was harmed.  Oh, to think what might have happened!

6340-6348	Now, Janet, I'll explain to you all about it.  It was half dream, half reality.  A woman did, I doubt not, enter your room: and that woman was--must have been--Grace Poole.  You call her a strange being yourself: from all you know, you have reason so to call her--what did she do to me? what to Mason?  In a state between sleeping and waking, you noticed her entrance and her actions; but feverish, almost delirious as you were, you ascribed to her a goblin appearance different from her own: the long dishevelled hair, the swelled black face, the exaggerated stature, were figments of imagination; results of nightmare: the spiteful tearing of the veil was real: and it is like her.  I see you would ask why I keep such a woman in my house: when we have been married a year and a day, I will tell you; but not now.  Are you satisfied, Jane?  Do you accept my solution of the mystery?

6351-6351	Does not Sophie sleep with Adele in the nursery?

6353-6353	Yes, sir.

6354-6355	And there is room enough in Adele's little bed for you.  You must share it with her to-night, Jane: it is no wonder that the incident you have related should make you nervous, and I would rather you did not sleep alone: promise me to go to the nursery.

6356-6356	I shall be very glad to do so, sir.

6357-6360	And fasten the door securely on the inside.  Wake Sophie when you go upstairs, under pretence of requesting her to rouse you in good time to- morrow; for you must be dressed and have finished breakfast before eight. And now, no more sombre thoughts: chase dull care away, Janet.  Don't you hear to what soft whispers the wind has fallen? and there is no more beating of rain against the window-panes: look here

6361-6361	it is a lovely night!

2-2	Well,

6366-6366	how is my Janet now?

6367-6367	The night is serene, sir; and so am I.

6368-6368	And you will not dream of separation and sorrow to-night; but of happy love and blissful union.

6376-6376	Stop!

6378-6378	Look at yourself in the mirror: you have not taken one peep.

6380-6380	Jane!

6384-6384	Lingerer!

6385-6385	my brain is on fire with impatience, and you tarry so long!

2-2	fair as a lily, and not only the pride of his life, but the desire of his eyes,

6388-6388	Is John getting the carriage ready?

6389-6389	Yes, sir.

6390-6390	Is the luggage brought down?

6391-6391	They are bringing it down, sir.

6392-6393	Go you to the church: see if Mr. Wood (the clergyman) and the clerk are there: return and tell me.

6395-6396	Mr. Wood is in the vestry, sir, putting on his surplice.

6397-6397	And the carriage?

6398-6398	The horses are harnessing.

6399-6399	We shall not want it to go to church; but it must be ready the moment we return: all the boxes and luggage arranged and strapped on, and the coachman in his seat.

6400-6400	Yes, sir.

6401-6401	Jane, are you ready?

6415-6415	Am I cruel in my love?

6417-6417	Delay an instant: lean on me, Jane.

6432-6432	I require and charge you both (as ye will answer at the dreadful day of judgment, when the secrets of all hearts shall be disclosed), that if either of you know any impediment why ye may not lawfully be joined together in matrimony, ye do now confess it; for be ye well assured that so many as are coupled together otherwise than God's Word doth allow, are not joined together by God, neither is their matrimony lawful.

6437-6437	Wilt thou have this woman for thy wedded wife?

6438-6438	The marriage cannot go on: I declare the existence of an impediment.

6440-6440	Proceed.

6443-6443	I cannot proceed without some investigation into what has been asserted, and evidence of its truth or falsehood.

2-2	The ceremony is quite broken off,

6445-6445	I am in a condition to prove my allegation: an insuperable impediment to this marriage exists.

6453-6453	What is the nature of the impediment?

6455-6455	Perhaps it may be got over--explained away?

2-2	Hardly,

6457-6457	I have called it insuperable, and I speak advisedly.

6459-6461	It simply consists in the existence of a previous marriage.  Mr. Rochester has a wife now living.

6468-6468	Who are you?

6470-6470	My name is Briggs, a solicitor of --- Street, London.

6471-6471	And you would thrust on me a wife?

6472-6472	I would remind you of your lady's existence, sir, which the law recognises, if you do not.

6473-6473	Favour me with an account of her--with her name, her parentage, her place of abode.

6474-6474	Certainly.

6476-6480	'I affirm and can prove that on the 20th of October A.D. --- (a date of fifteen years back), Edward Fairfax Rochester, of Thornfield Hall, in the county of ---, and of Ferndean Manor, in ---shire, England, was married to my sister, Bertha Antoinetta Mason, daughter of Jonas Mason, merchant, and of Antoinetta his wife, a Creole, at --- church, Spanish Town, Jamaica.  The record of the marriage will be found in the register of that church--a copy of it is now in my possession.  Signed, Richard Mason.'

6481-6481	That--if a genuine document--may prove I have been married, but it does not prove that the woman mentioned therein as my wife is still living.

2-2	She was living three months ago,

6483-6483	How do you know?

6484-6484	I have a witness to the fact, whose testimony even you, sir, will scarcely controvert.

6485-6485	Produce him--or go to hell.

6486-6488	I will produce him first--he is on the spot.  Mr. Mason, have the goodness to step forward.

6494-6494	Good God!

6496-6496	What have _you_ to say?

6498-6499	The devil is in it if you cannot answer distinctly.  I again demand, what have you to say?

2-2	Sir--sir,

6500-6500	do not forget you are in a sacred place.

6501-6501	Are you aware, sir, whether or not this gentleman's wife is still living?

2-2	Courage,

6502-6502	speak out.

2-2	She is now living at Thornfield Hall,

6503-6504	I saw her there last April.  I am her brother.

6505-6505	At Thornfield Hall!

6507-6509	Impossible!  I am an old resident in this neighbourhood, sir, and I never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at Thornfield Hall.

6511-6512	No, by God!  I took care that none should hear of it--or of her under that name.

6513-6515	Enough! all shall bolt out at once, like the bullet from the barrel. Wood, close your book and take off your surplice; John Green (to the clerk), leave the church: there will be no wedding to-day.

6518-6540	Bigamy is an ugly word!--I meant, however, to be a bigamist; but fate has out-manoeuvred me, or Providence has checked me,--perhaps the last.  I am little better than a devil at this moment; and, as my pastor there would tell me, deserve no doubt the sternest judgments of God, even to the quenchless fire and deathless worm.  Gentlemen, my plan is broken up:--what this lawyer and his client say is true: I have been married, and the woman to whom I was married lives!  You say you never heard of a Mrs. Rochester at the house up yonder, Wood; but I daresay you have many a time inclined your ear to gossip about the mysterious lunatic kept there under watch and ward.  Some have whispered to you that she is my bastard half-sister: some, my cast-off mistress.  I now inform you that she is my wife, whom I married fifteen years ago,--Bertha Mason by name; sister of this resolute personage, who is now, with his quivering limbs and white cheeks, showing you what a stout heart men may bear.  Cheer up, Dick!--never fear me!--I'd almost as soon strike a woman as you.  Bertha Mason is mad; and she came of a mad family; idiots and maniacs through three generations!  Her mother, the Creole, was both a madwoman and a drunkard!--as I found out after I had wed the daughter: for they were silent on family secrets before.  Bertha, like a dutiful child, copied her parent in both points. I had a charming partner--pure, wise, modest: you can fancy I was a happy man.  I went through rich scenes!  Oh! my experience has been heavenly, if you only knew it!  But I owe you no further explanation.  Briggs, Wood, Mason, I invite you all to come up to the house and visit Mrs. Poole's patient, and _my wife_!  You shall see what sort of a being I was cheated into espousing, and judge whether or not I had a right to break the compact, and seek sympathy with something at least human.  This girl,

6541-6542	knew no more than you, Wood, of the disgusting secret: she thought all was fair and legal and never dreamt she was going to be entrapped into a feigned union with a defrauded wretch, already bound to a bad, mad, and embruted partner!  Come all of you--follow!

2-2	Take it back to the coach-house, John,

6546-6546	it will not be wanted to-day.

6549-6549	To the right-about--every soul!

6550-6553	away with your congratulations!  Who wants them?  Not I!--they are fifteen years too late!

2-2	You know this place, Mason,

6557-6557	she bit and stabbed you here.

6563-6564	Good-morrow, Mrs. Poole!

6567-6568	How are you? and how is your charge to-day?

2-2	We're tolerable, sir, I thank you,

6569-6569	rather snappish, but not 'rageous.

6571-6572	Ah! sir, she sees you!

6573-6573	you'd better not stay.

6574-6574	Only a few moments, Grace: you must allow me a few moments.

6575-6576	Take care then, sir!--for God's sake, take care!

2-2	Keep out of the way,

6582-6582	she has no knife now, I suppose, and I'm on my guard.

6583-6583	One never knows what she has, sir: she is so cunning: it is not in mortal discretion to fathom her craft.

2-2	We had better leave her,

6585-6585	Go to the devil!

6587-6587	'Ware!

2-2	That is _my wife_,

6599-6599	Such is the sole conjugal embrace I am ever to know--such are the endearments which are to solace my leisure hours!  And _this_ is what I wished to have

6600-6604	this young girl, who stands so grave and quiet at the mouth of hell, looking collectedly at the gambols of a demon, I wanted her just as a change after that fierce ragout.  Wood and Briggs, look at the difference!  Compare these clear eyes with the red balls yonder--this face with that mask--this form with that bulk; then judge me, priest of the gospel and man of the law, and remember with what judgment ye judge ye shall be judged!  Off with you now.  I must shut up my prize.

2-2	You, madam,

6609-6610	are cleared from all blame: your uncle will be glad to hear it--if, indeed, he should be still living--when Mr. Mason returns to Madeira.

6611-6613	My uncle!  What of him?  Do you know him?

6614-6633	Mr. Mason does.  Mr. Eyre has been the Funchal correspondent of his house for some years.  When your uncle received your letter intimating the contemplated union between yourself and Mr. Rochester, Mr. Mason, who was staying at Madeira to recruit his health, on his way back to Jamaica, happened to be with him.  Mr. Eyre mentioned the intelligence; for he knew that my client here was acquainted with a gentleman of the name of Rochester.  Mr. Mason, astonished and distressed as you may suppose, revealed the real state of matters.  Your uncle, I am sorry to say, is now on a sick bed; from which, considering the nature of his disease--decline--and the stage it has reached, it is unlikely he will ever rise.  He could not then hasten to England himself, to extricate you from the snare into which you had fallen, but he implored Mr. Mason to lose no time in taking steps to prevent the false marriage.  He referred him to me for assistance.  I used all despatch, and am thankful I was not too late: as you, doubtless, must be also.  Were I not morally certain that your uncle will be dead ere you reach Madeira, I would advise you to accompany Mr. Mason back; but as it is, I think you had better remain in England till you can hear further, either from or of Mr. Eyre.  Have we anything else to stay for?

2-2	No, no--let us be gone,

6668-6668	Be not far from me, for trouble is near: there is none to help.

6671-6671	the waters came into my soul; I sank in deep mire: I felt no standing; I came into deep waters; the floods overflowed me.

6672-6672	What am I to do?

2-2	Leave Thornfield at once

6674-6674	That I am not Edward Rochester's bride is the least part of my woe,

6675-6676	that I have wakened out of most glorious dreams, and found them all void and vain, is a horror I could bear and master; but that I must leave him decidedly, instantly, entirely, is intolerable.  I cannot do it.

2-2	Let me be torn away,

6680-6680	Let another help me!

6681-6681	No; you shall tear yourself away, none shall help you: you shall yourself pluck out your right eye; yourself cut off your right hand: your heart shall be the victim, and you the priest to transfix it.

6683-6683	Friends always forget those whom fortune forsakes,

2-2	You come out at last,

6694-6703	Well, I have been waiting for you long, and listening: yet not one movement have I heard, nor one sob: five minutes more of that death-like hush, and I should have forced the lock like a burglar.  So you shun me?--you shut yourself up and grieve alone! I would rather you had come and upbraided me with vehemence.  You are passionate.  I expected a scene of some kind.  I was prepared for the hot rain of tears; only I wanted them to be shed on my breast: now a senseless floor has received them, or your drenched handkerchief.  But I err: you have not wept at all!  I see a white cheek and a faded eye, but no trace of tears.  I suppose, then, your heart has been weeping blood?

6704-6708	Well, Jane! not a word of reproach?  Nothing bitter--nothing poignant? Nothing to cut a feeling or sting a passion?  You sit quietly where I have placed you, and regard me with a weary, passive look.

6709-6711	Jane, I never meant to wound you thus.  If the man who had but one little ewe lamb that was dear to him as a daughter, that ate of his bread and drank of his cup, and lay in his bosom, had by some mistake slaughtered it at the shambles, he would not have rued his bloody blunder more than I now rue mine.  Will you ever forgive me?

6714-6714	You know I am a scoundrel, Jane?

6716-6716	Yes, sir.

6717-6717	Then tell me so roundly and sharply--don't spare me.

6718-6719	I cannot: I am tired and sick.  I want some water.

6721-6721	If I could go out of life now, without too sharp a pang, it would be well for me,

6724-6727	then I should not have to make the effort of cracking my heart-strings in rending them from among Mr. Rochester's.  I must leave him, it appears.  I do not want to leave him--I cannot leave him.

6728-6728	How are you now, Jane?

6729-6729	Much better, sir; I shall be well soon.

6730-6730	Taste the wine again, Jane.

6734-6735	What!--How is this?

6737-6739	Oh, I know! you won't kiss the husband of Bertha Mason?  You consider my arms filled and my embraces appropriated?

6740-6740	At any rate, there is neither room nor claim for me, sir.

6741-6743	Why, Jane?  I will spare you the trouble of much talking; I will answer for you--Because I have a wife already, you would reply.--I guess rightly?

6744-6744	Yes.

6745-6748	If you think so, you must have a strange opinion of me; you must regard me as a plotting profligate--a base and low rake who has been simulating disinterested love in order to draw you into a snare deliberately laid, and strip you of honour and rob you of self-respect.  What do you say to that?  I see you can say nothing in the first place, you are faint still, and have enough to do to draw your breath; in the second place, you cannot yet accustom yourself to accuse and revile me, and besides, the flood-gates of tears are opened, and they would rush out if you spoke much; and you have no desire to expostulate, to upbraid, to make a scene: you are thinking how _to act_--_talking_ you consider is of no use.  I know you--I am on my guard.

2-2	Sir, I do not wish to act against you,

6750-6752	Not in your sense of the word, but in mine you are scheming to destroy me.  You have as good as said that I am a married man--as a married man you will shun me, keep out of my way: just now you have refused to kiss me.  You intend to make yourself a complete stranger to me: to live under this roof only as Adele's governess; if ever I say a friendly word to you, if ever a friendly feeling inclines you again to me, you will say,--'That man had nearly made me his mistress: I must be ice and rock to him;' and ice and rock you will accordingly become.

6753-6753	All is changed about me, sir; I must change too--there is no doubt of that; and to avoid fluctuations of feeling, and continual combats with recollections and associations, there is only one way--Adele must have a new governess, sir.

6754-6758	Oh, Adele will go to school--I have settled that already; nor do I mean to torment you with the hideous associations and recollections of Thornfield Hall--this accursed place--this tent of Achan--this insolent vault, offering the ghastliness of living death to the light of the open sky--this narrow stone hell, with its one real fiend, worse than a legion of such as we imagine.  Jane, you shall not stay here, nor will I.  I was wrong ever to bring you to Thornfield Hall, knowing as I did how it was haunted.  I charged them to conceal from you, before I ever saw you, all knowledge of the curse of the place; merely because I feared Adele never would have a governess to stay if she knew with what inmate she was housed, and my plans would not permit me to remove the maniac elsewhere--though I possess an old house, Ferndean Manor, even more retired and hidden than this, where I could have lodged her safely enough, had not a scruple about the unhealthiness of the situation, in the heart of a wood, made my conscience recoil from the arrangement. Probably those damp walls would soon have eased me of her charge: but to each villain his own vice; and mine is not a tendency to indirect assassination, even of what I most hate.

6759-6760	Concealing the mad-woman's neighbourhood from you, however, was something like covering a child with a cloak and laying it down near a upas-tree: that demon's vicinage is poisoned, and always was.  But I'll shut up Thornfield Hall: I'll nail up the front door and board the lower windows: I'll give Mrs. Poole two hundred a year to live here with _my wife_, as you term that fearful hag: Grace will do much for money, and she shall have her son, the keeper at Grimsby Retreat, to bear her company and be at hand to give her aid in the paroxysms, when _my wife_ is prompted by her familiar to burn people in their beds at night, to stab them, to bite their flesh from their bones, and so on--

2-2	Sir,

6761-6762	you are inexorable for that unfortunate lady: you speak of her with hate--with vindictive antipathy.  It is cruel--she cannot help being mad.

6763-6764	Jane, my little darling (so I will call you, for so you are), you don't know what you are talking about; you misjudge me again: it is not because she is mad I hate her.  If you were mad, do you think I should hate you?

6765-6765	I do indeed, sir.

6766-6774	Then you are mistaken, and you know nothing about me, and nothing about the sort of love of which I am capable.  Every atom of your flesh is as dear to me as my own: in pain and sickness it would still be dear.  Your mind is my treasure, and if it were broken, it would be my treasure still: if you raved, my arms should confine you, and not a strait waistcoat--your grasp, even in fury, would have a charm for me: if you flew at me as wildly as that woman did this morning, I should receive you in an embrace, at least as fond as it would be restrictive.  I should not shrink from you with disgust as I did from her: in your quiet moments you should have no watcher and no nurse but me; and I could hang over you with untiring tenderness, though you gave me no smile in return; and never weary of gazing into your eyes, though they had no longer a ray of recognition for me.--But why do I follow that train of ideas?  I was talking of removing you from Thornfield.  All, you know, is prepared for prompt departure: to-morrow you shall go.  I only ask you to endure one more night under this roof, Jane; and then, farewell to its miseries and terrors for ever!  I have a place to repair to, which will be a secure sanctuary from hateful reminiscences, from unwelcome intrusion--even from falsehood and slander.

2-2	And take Adele with you, sir,

6775-6775	she will be a companion for you.

6776-6779	What do you mean, Jane?  I told you I would send Adele to school; and what do I want with a child for a companion, and not my own child,--a French dancer's bastard?  Why do you importune me about her!  I say, why do you assign Adele to me for a companion?

6780-6780	You spoke of a retirement, sir; and retirement and solitude are dull: too dull for you.

6781-6782	Solitude! solitude!

6784-6787	I see I must come to an explanation.  I don't know what sphynx-like expression is forming in your countenance.  You are to share my solitude.  Do you understand?

2-2	Now for the hitch in Jane's character,

6792-6795	The reel of silk has run smoothly enough so far; but I always knew there would come a knot and a puzzle: here it is.  Now for vexation, and exasperation, and endless trouble!  By God!  I long to exert a fraction of Samson's strength, and break the entanglement like tow!

6797-6798	Jane! will you hear reason?

6799-6799	because, if you won't, I'll try violence.

6806-6806	Sit down; I'll talk to you as long as you like, and hear all you have to say, whether reasonable or unreasonable.

6814-6815	But I am not angry, Jane: I only love you too well; and you had steeled your little pale face with such a resolute, frozen look, I could not endure it.  Hush, now, and wipe your eyes.

6819-6820	Jane! Jane!

6821-6823	you don't love me, then?  It was only my station, and the rank of my wife, that you valued?  Now that you think me disqualified to become your husband, you recoil from my touch as if I were some toad or ape.

2-2	I _do_ love you,

6826-6826	more than ever: but I must not show or indulge the feeling: and this is the last time I must express it.

6827-6829	The last time, Jane!  What! do you think you can live with me, and see me daily, and yet, if you still love me, be always cold and distant?

6830-6830	No, sir; that I am certain I could not; and therefore I see there is but one way: but you will be furious if I mention it.

6831-6832	Oh, mention it!  If I storm, you have the art of weeping.

6833-6834	Mr. Rochester, I must leave you.

6835-6836	For how long, Jane?  For a few minutes, while you smooth your hair--which is somewhat dishevelled; and bathe your face--which looks feverish?

6837-6838	I must leave Adele and Thornfield.  I must part with you for my whole life: I must begin a new existence among strange faces and strange scenes.

6839-6850	Of course: I told you you should.  I pass over the madness about parting from me.  You mean you must become a part of me.  As to the new existence, it is all right: you shall yet be my wife: I am not married. You shall be Mrs. Rochester--both virtually and nominally.  I shall keep only to you so long as you and I live.  You shall go to a place I have in the south of France: a whitewashed villa on the shores of the Mediterranean.  There you shall live a happy, and guarded, and most innocent life.  Never fear that I wish to lure you into error--to make you my mistress.  Why did you shake your head?  Jane, you must be reasonable, or in truth I shall again become frantic.

6852-6853	Sir, your wife is living: that is a fact acknowledged this morning by yourself.  If I lived with you as you desire, I should then be your mistress: to say otherwise is sophistical--is false.

6854-6855	Jane, I am not a gentle-tempered man--you forget that: I am not long- enduring; I am not cool and dispassionate.  Out of pity to me and yourself, put your finger on my pulse, feel how it throbs, and--beware!

6858-6858	God help me!

6860-6860	I am a fool!

6863-6867	I keep telling her I am not married, and do not explain to her why.  I forget she knows nothing of the character of that woman, or of the circumstances attending my infernal union with her.  Oh, I am certain Jane will agree with me in opinion, when she knows all that I know!  Just put your hand in mine, Janet--that I may have the evidence of touch as well as sight, to prove you are near me--and I will in a few words show you the real state of the case.  Can you listen to me?

6868-6868	Yes, sir; for hours if you will.

6869-6870	I ask only minutes.  Jane, did you ever hear or know that I was not the eldest son of my house: that I had once a brother older than I?

6871-6872	I remember Mrs. Fairfax told me so once.

6873-6873	And did you ever hear that my father was an avaricious, grasping man?

6874-6874	I have understood something to that effect.

6875-6899	Well, Jane, being so, it was his resolution to keep the property together; he could not bear the idea of dividing his estate and leaving me a fair portion: all, he resolved, should go to my brother, Rowland. Yet as little could he endure that a son of his should be a poor man.  I must be provided for by a wealthy marriage.  He sought me a partner betimes.  Mr. Mason, a West India planter and merchant, was his old acquaintance.  He was certain his possessions were real and vast: he made inquiries.  Mr. Mason, he found, had a son and daughter; and he learned from him that he could and would give the latter a fortune of thirty thousand pounds: that sufficed.  When I left college, I was sent out to Jamaica, to espouse a bride already courted for me.  My father said nothing about her money; but he told me Miss Mason was the boast of Spanish Town for her beauty: and this was no lie.  I found her a fine woman, in the style of Blanche Ingram: tall, dark, and majestic.  Her family wished to secure me because I was of a good race; and so did she. They showed her to me in parties, splendidly dressed.  I seldom saw her alone, and had very little private conversation with her.  She flattered me, and lavishly displayed for my pleasure her charms and accomplishments.  All the men in her circle seemed to admire her and envy me.  I was dazzled, stimulated: my senses were excited; and being ignorant, raw, and inexperienced, I thought I loved her.  There is no folly so besotted that the idiotic rivalries of society, the prurience, the rashness, the blindness of youth, will not hurry a man to its commission.  Her relatives encouraged me; competitors piqued me; she allured me: a marriage was achieved almost before I knew where I was.  Oh, I have no respect for myself when I think of that act!--an agony of inward contempt masters me.  I never loved, I never esteemed, I did not even know her.  I was not sure of the existence of one virtue in her nature: I had marked neither modesty, nor benevolence, nor candour, nor refinement in her mind or manners--and, I married her:--gross, grovelling, mole-eyed blockhead that I was!  With less sin I might have--But let me remember to whom I am speaking.

6900-6904	My bride's mother I had never seen: I understood she was dead.  The honeymoon over, I learned my mistake; she was only mad, and shut up in a lunatic asylum.  There was a younger brother, too--a complete dumb idiot. The elder one, whom you have seen (and whom I cannot hate, whilst I abhor all his kindred, because he has some grains of affection in his feeble mind, shown in the continued interest he takes in his wretched sister, and also in a dog-like attachment he once bore me), will probably be in the same state one day.  My father and my brother Rowland knew all this; but they thought only of the thirty thousand pounds, and joined in the plot against me.

6905-6905	These were vile discoveries; but except for the treachery of concealment, I should have made them no subject of reproach to my wife, even when I found her nature wholly alien to mine, her tastes obnoxious to me, her cast of mind common, low, narrow, and singularly incapable of being led to anything higher, expanded to anything larger--when I found that I could not pass a single evening, nor even a single hour of the day with her in comfort; that kindly conversation could not be sustained between us, because whatever topic I started, immediately received from her a turn at once coarse and trite, perverse and imbecile--when I perceived that I should never have a quiet or settled household, because no servant would bear the continued outbreaks of her violent and unreasonable temper, or the vexations of her absurd, contradictory, exacting orders--even then I restrained myself: I eschewed upbraiding, I curtailed remonstrance; I tried to devour my repentance and disgust in secret; I repressed the deep antipathy I felt.

6906-6910	Jane, I will not trouble you with abominable details: some strong words shall express what I have to say.  I lived with that woman upstairs four years, and before that time she had tried me indeed: her character ripened and developed with frightful rapidity; her vices sprang up fast and rank: they were so strong, only cruelty could check them, and I would not use cruelty.  What a pigmy intellect she had, and what giant propensities!  How fearful were the curses those propensities entailed on me!  Bertha Mason, the true daughter of an infamous mother, dragged me through all the hideous and degrading agonies which must attend a man bound to a wife at once intemperate and unchaste.

6911-6914	My brother in the interval was dead, and at the end of the four years my father died too.  I was rich enough now--yet poor to hideous indigence: a nature the most gross, impure, depraved I ever saw, was associated with mine, and called by the law and by society a part of me.  And I could not rid myself of it by any legal proceedings: for the doctors now discovered that _my wife_ was mad--her excesses had prematurely developed the germs of insanity.  Jane, you don't like my narrative; you look almost sick--shall I defer the rest to another day?

6915-6915	No, sir, finish it now; I pity you--I do earnestly pity you.

6916-6919	Pity, Jane, from some people is a noxious and insulting sort of tribute, which one is justified in hurling back in the teeth of those who offer it; but that is the sort of pity native to callous, selfish hearts; it is a hybrid, egotistical pain at hearing of woes, crossed with ignorant contempt for those who have endured them.  But that is not your pity, Jane; it is not the feeling of which your whole face is full at this moment--with which your eyes are now almost overflowing--with which your heart is heaving--with which your hand is trembling in mine.  Your pity, my darling, is the suffering mother of love: its anguish is the very natal pang of the divine passion.  I accept it, Jane; let the daughter have free advent--my arms wait to receive her.

6920-6920	Now, sir, proceed; what did you do when you found she was mad?

6921-6925	Jane, I approached the verge of despair; a remnant of self-respect was all that intervened between me and the gulf.  In the eyes of the world, I was doubtless covered with grimy dishonour; but I resolved to be clean in my own sight--and to the last I repudiated the contamination of her crimes, and wrenched myself from connection with her mental defects. Still, society associated my name and person with hers; I yet saw her and heard her daily: something of her breath (faugh!) mixed with the air I breathed; and besides, I remembered I had once been her husband--that recollection was then, and is now, inexpressibly odious to me; moreover, I knew that while she lived I could never be the husband of another and better wife; and, though five years my senior (her family and her father had lied to me even in the particular of her age), she was likely to live as long as I, being as robust in frame as she was infirm in mind.  Thus, at the age of twenty-six, I was hopeless.

6926-6931	One night I had been awakened by her yells--(since the medical men had pronounced her mad, she had, of course, been shut up)--it was a fiery West Indian night; one of the description that frequently precede the hurricanes of those climates.  Being unable to sleep in bed, I got up and opened the window.  The air was like sulphur-steams--I could find no refreshment anywhere.  Mosquitoes came buzzing in and hummed sullenly round the room; the sea, which I could hear from thence, rumbled dull like an earthquake--black clouds were casting up over it; the moon was setting in the waves, broad and red, like a hot cannon-ball--she threw her last bloody glance over a world quivering with the ferment of tempest.  I was physically influenced by the atmosphere and scene, and my ears were filled with the curses the maniac still shrieked out; wherein she momentarily mingled my name with such a tone of demon-hate, with such language!--no professed harlot ever had a fouler vocabulary than she: though two rooms off, I heard every word--the thin partitions of the West India house opposing but slight obstruction to her wolfish cries.

6932-6935	'This life,' said I at last, 'is hell: this is the air--those are the sounds of the bottomless pit!  I have a right to deliver myself from it if I can.  The sufferings of this mortal state will leave me with the heavy flesh that now cumbers my soul.  Of the fanatic's burning eternity I have no fear: there is not a future state worse than this present one--let me break away, and go home to God!'

6936-6937	I said this whilst I knelt down at, and unlocked a trunk which contained a brace of loaded pistols: I mean to shoot myself.  I only entertained the intention for a moment; for, not being insane, the crisis of exquisite and unalloyed despair, which had originated the wish and design of self-destruction, was past in a second.

6938-6940	A wind fresh from Europe blew over the ocean and rushed through the open casement: the storm broke, streamed, thundered, blazed, and the air grew pure.  I then framed and fixed a resolution.  While I walked under the dripping orange-trees of my wet garden, and amongst its drenched pomegranates and pine-apples, and while the refulgent dawn of the tropics kindled round me--I reasoned thus, Jane--and now listen; for it was true Wisdom that consoled me in that hour, and showed me the right path to follow.

6941-6942	The sweet wind from Europe was still whispering in the refreshed leaves, and the Atlantic was thundering in glorious liberty; my heart, dried up and scorched for a long time, swelled to the tone, and filled with living blood--my being longed for renewal--my soul thirsted for a pure draught. I saw hope revive--and felt regeneration possible.  From a flowery arch at the bottom of my garden I gazed over the sea--bluer than the sky: the old world was beyond; clear prospects opened thus:--

6943-6948	'Go,' said Hope, 'and live again in Europe: there it is not known what a sullied name you bear, nor what a filthy burden is bound to you.  You may take the maniac with you to England; confine her with due attendance and precautions at Thornfield: then travel yourself to what clime you will, and form what new tie you like.  That woman, who has so abused your long- suffering, so sullied your name, so outraged your honour, so blighted your youth, is not your wife, nor are you her husband.  See that she is cared for as her condition demands, and you have done all that God and humanity require of you.  Let her identity, her connection with yourself, be buried in oblivion: you are bound to impart them to no living being. Place her in safety and comfort: shelter her degradation with secrecy, and leave her.'

6949-6951	I acted precisely on this suggestion.  My father and brother had not made my marriage known to their acquaintance; because, in the very first letter I wrote to apprise them of the union--having already begun to experience extreme disgust of its consequences, and, from the family character and constitution, seeing a hideous future opening to me--I added an urgent charge to keep it secret: and very soon the infamous conduct of the wife my father had selected for me was such as to make him blush to own her as his daughter-in-law.  Far from desiring to publish the connection, he became as anxious to conceal it as myself.

6952-6962	To England, then, I conveyed her; a fearful voyage I had with such a monster in the vessel.  Glad was I when I at last got her to Thornfield, and saw her safely lodged in that third-storey room, of whose secret inner cabinet she has now for ten years made a wild beast's den--a goblin's cell.  I had some trouble in finding an attendant for her, as it was necessary to select one on whose fidelity dependence could be placed; for her ravings would inevitably betray my secret: besides, she had lucid intervals of days--sometimes weeks--which she filled up with abuse of me. At last I hired Grace Poole from the Grimbsy Retreat.  She and the surgeon, Carter (who dressed Mason's wounds that night he was stabbed and worried), are the only two I have ever admitted to my confidence.  Mrs. Fairfax may indeed have suspected something, but she could have gained no precise knowledge as to facts.  Grace has, on the whole, proved a good keeper; though, owing partly to a fault of her own, of which it appears nothing can cure her, and which is incident to her harassing profession, her vigilance has been more than once lulled and baffled.  The lunatic is both cunning and malignant; she has never failed to take advantage of her guardian's temporary lapses; once to secrete the knife with which she stabbed her brother, and twice to possess herself of the key of her cell, and issue therefrom in the night-time.  On the first of these occasions, she perpetrated the attempt to burn me in my bed; on the second, she paid that ghastly visit to you.  I thank Providence, who watched over you, that she then spent her fury on your wedding apparel, which perhaps brought back vague reminiscences of her own bridal days: but on what might have happened, I cannot endure to reflect.  When I think of the thing which flew at my throat this morning, hanging its black and scarlet visage over the nest of my dove, my blood curdles--

2-2	And what, sir,

6963-6964	did you do when you had settled her here?  Where did you go?

6965-6969	What did I do, Jane?  I transformed myself into a will-o'-the-wisp. Where did I go?  I pursued wanderings as wild as those of the March-spirit.  I sought the Continent, and went devious through all its lands.  My fixed desire was to seek and find a good and intelligent woman, whom I could love: a contrast to the fury I left at Thornfield--

6970-6970	But you could not marry, sir.

6971-6973	I had determined and was convinced that I could and ought.  It was not my original intention to deceive, as I have deceived you.  I meant to tell my tale plainly, and make my proposals openly: and it appeared to me so absolutely rational that I should be considered free to love and be loved, I never doubted some woman might be found willing and able to understand my case and accept me, in spite of the curse with which I was burdened.

6974-6974	Well, sir?

6975-6978	When you are inquisitive, Jane, you always make me smile.  You open your eyes like an eager bird, and make every now and then a restless movement, as if answers in speech did not flow fast enough for you, and you wanted to read the tablet of one's heart.  But before I go on, tell me what you mean by your 'Well, sir?'  It is a small phrase very frequent with you; and which many a time has drawn me on and on through interminable talk: I don't very well know why.

6979-6981	I mean,--What next?  How did you proceed?  What came of such an event?

6982-6983	Precisely! and what do you wish to know now?

6984-6984	Whether you found any one you liked: whether you asked her to marry you; and what she said.

6985-6998	I can tell you whether I found any one I liked, and whether I asked her to marry me: but what she said is yet to be recorded in the book of Fate. For ten long years I roved about, living first in one capital, then another: sometimes in St. Petersburg; oftener in Paris; occasionally in Rome, Naples, and Florence.  Provided with plenty of money and the passport of an old name, I could choose my own society: no circles were closed against me.  I sought my ideal of a woman amongst English ladies, French countesses, Italian signoras, and German grafinnen.  I could not find her.  Sometimes, for a fleeting moment, I thought I caught a glance, heard a tone, beheld a form, which announced the realisation of my dream: but I was presently undeserved.  You are not to suppose that I desired perfection, either of mind or person.  I longed only for what suited me--for the antipodes of the Creole: and I longed vainly.  Amongst them all I found not one whom, had I been ever so free, I--warned as I was of the risks, the horrors, the loathings of incongruous unions--would have asked to marry me.  Disappointment made me reckless.  I tried dissipation--never debauchery: that I hated, and hate.  That was my Indian Messalina's attribute: rooted disgust at it and her restrained me much, even in pleasure.  Any enjoyment that bordered on riot seemed to approach me to her and her vices, and I eschewed it.

6999-7008	Yet I could not live alone; so I tried the companionship of mistresses. The first I chose was Celine Varens--another of those steps which make a man spurn himself when he recalls them.  You already know what she was, and how my liaison with her terminated.  She had two successors: an Italian, Giacinta, and a German, Clara; both considered singularly handsome.  What was their beauty to me in a few weeks?  Giacinta was unprincipled and violent: I tired of her in three months.  Clara was honest and quiet; but heavy, mindless, and unimpressible: not one whit to my taste.  I was glad to give her a sufficient sum to set her up in a good line of business, and so get decently rid of her.  But, Jane, I see by your face you are not forming a very favourable opinion of me just now.  You think me an unfeeling, loose-principled rake: don't you?

7009-7011	I don't like you so well as I have done sometimes, indeed, sir.  Did it not seem to you in the least wrong to live in that way, first with one mistress and then another?  You talk of it as a mere matter of course.

7012-7015	It was with me; and I did not like it.  It was a grovelling fashion of existence: I should never like to return to it.  Hiring a mistress is the next worse thing to buying a slave: both are often by nature, and always by position, inferior: and to live familiarly with inferiors is degrading.  I now hate the recollection of the time I passed with Celine, Giacinta, and Clara.

7019-7024	Now, Jane, why don't you say 'Well, sir?'  I have not done.  You are looking grave.  You disapprove of me still, I see.  But let me come to the point.  Last January, rid of all mistresses--in a harsh, bitter frame of mind, the result of a useless, roving, lonely life--corroded with disappointment, sourly disposed against all men, and especially against all womankind (for I began to regard the notion of an intellectual, faithful, loving woman as a mere dream), recalled by business, I came back to England.

7025-7034	On a frosty winter afternoon, I rode in sight of Thornfield Hall. Abhorred spot!  I expected no peace--no pleasure there.  On a stile in Hay Lane I saw a quiet little figure sitting by itself.  I passed it as negligently as I did the pollard willow opposite to it: I had no presentiment of what it would be to me; no inward warning that the arbitress of my life--my genius for good or evil--waited there in humble guise.  I did not know it, even when, on the occasion of Mesrour's accident, it came up and gravely offered me help.  Childish and slender creature!  It seemed as if a linnet had hopped to my foot and proposed to bear me on its tiny wing.  I was surly; but the thing would not go: it stood by me with strange perseverance, and looked and spoke with a sort of authority.  I must be aided, and by that hand: and aided I was.

7035-7052	When once I had pressed the frail shoulder, something new--a fresh sap and sense--stole into my frame.  It was well I had learnt that this elf must return to me--that it belonged to my house down below--or I could not have felt it pass away from under my hand, and seen it vanish behind the dim hedge, without singular regret.  I heard you come home that night, Jane, though probably you were not aware that I thought of you or watched for you.  The next day I observed you--myself unseen--for half-an- hour, while you played with Adele in the gallery.  It was a snowy day, I recollect, and you could not go out of doors.  I was in my room; the door was ajar: I could both listen and watch.  Adele claimed your outward attention for a while; yet I fancied your thoughts were elsewhere: but you were very patient with her, my little Jane; you talked to her and amused her a long time.  When at last she left you, you lapsed at once into deep reverie: you betook yourself slowly to pace the gallery.  Now and then, in passing a casement, you glanced out at the thick-falling snow; you listened to the sobbing wind, and again you paced gently on and dreamed.  I think those day visions were not dark: there was a pleasurable illumination in your eye occasionally, a soft excitement in your aspect, which told of no bitter, bilious, hypochondriac brooding: your look revealed rather the sweet musings of youth when its spirit follows on willing wings the flight of Hope up and on to an ideal heaven. The voice of Mrs. Fairfax, speaking to a servant in the hall, wakened you: and how curiously you smiled to and at yourself, Janet!  There was much sense in your smile: it was very shrewd, and seemed to make light of your own abstraction.  It seemed to say--'My fine visions are all very well, but I must not forget they are absolutely unreal.  I have a rosy sky and a green flowery Eden in my brain; but without, I am perfectly aware, lies at my feet a rough tract to travel, and around me gather black tempests to encounter.'  You ran downstairs and demanded of Mrs. Fairfax some occupation: the weekly house accounts to make up, or something of that sort, I think it was.  I was vexed with you for getting out of my sight.

7053-7065	Impatiently I waited for evening, when I might summon you to my presence.  An unusual--to me--a perfectly new character I suspected was yours: I desired to search it deeper and know it better.  You entered the room with a look and air at once shy and independent: you were quaintly dressed--much as you are now.  I made you talk: ere long I found you full of strange contrasts.  Your garb and manner were restricted by rule; your air was often diffident, and altogether that of one refined by nature, but absolutely unused to society, and a good deal afraid of making herself disadvantageously conspicuous by some solecism or blunder; yet when addressed, you lifted a keen, a daring, and a glowing eye to your interlocutor's face: there was penetration and power in each glance you gave; when plied by close questions, you found ready and round answers. Very soon you seemed to get used to me: I believe you felt the existence of sympathy between you and your grim and cross master, Jane; for it was astonishing to see how quickly a certain pleasant ease tranquillised your manner: snarl as I would, you showed no surprise, fear, annoyance, or displeasure at my moroseness; you watched me, and now and then smiled at me with a simple yet sagacious grace I cannot describe.  I was at once content and stimulated with what I saw: I liked what I had seen, and wished to see more.  Yet, for a long time, I treated you distantly, and sought your company rarely.  I was an intellectual epicure, and wished to prolong the gratification of making this novel and piquant acquaintance: besides, I was for a while troubled with a haunting fear that if I handled the flower freely its bloom would fade--the sweet charm of freshness would leave it.  I did not then know that it was no transitory blossom, but rather the radiant resemblance of one, cut in an indestructible gem.  Moreover, I wished to see whether you would seek me if I shunned you--but you did not; you kept in the schoolroom as still as your own desk and easel; if by chance I met you, you passed me as soon, and with as little token of recognition, as was consistent with respect. Your habitual expression in those days, Jane, was a thoughtful look; not despondent, for you were not sickly; but not buoyant, for you had little hope, and no actual pleasure.  I wondered what you thought of me, or if you ever thought of me, and resolved to find this out.

7066-7070	I resumed my notice of you.  There was something glad in your glance, and genial in your manner, when you conversed: I saw you had a social heart; it was the silent schoolroom--it was the tedium of your life--that made you mournful.  I permitted myself the delight of being kind to you; kindness stirred emotion soon: your face became soft in expression, your tones gentle; I liked my name pronounced by your lips in a grateful happy accent.  I used to enjoy a chance meeting with you, Jane, at this time: there was a curious hesitation in your manner: you glanced at me with a slight trouble--a hovering doubt: you did not know what my caprice might be--whether I was going to play the master and be stern, or the friend and be benignant.  I was now too fond of you often to simulate the first whim; and, when I stretched my hand out cordially, such bloom and light and bliss rose to your young, wistful features, I had much ado often to avoid straining you then and there to my heart.

2-2	Don't talk any more of those days, sir,

2-2	No, Jane,

7072-7072	what necessity is there to dwell on the Past, when the Present is so much surer--the Future so much brighter?

7074-7074	You see now how the case stands--do you not?

7076-7079	After a youth and manhood passed half in unutterable misery and half in dreary solitude, I have for the first time found what I can truly love--I have found you.  You are my sympathy--my better self--my good angel.  I am bound to you with a strong attachment.  I think you good, gifted, lovely: a fervent, a solemn passion is conceived in my heart; it leans to you, draws you to my centre and spring of life, wraps my existence about you, and, kindling in pure, powerful flame, fuses you and me in one.

7080-7086	It was because I felt and knew this, that I resolved to marry you.  To tell me that I had already a wife is empty mockery: you know now that I had but a hideous demon.  I was wrong to attempt to deceive you; but I feared a stubbornness that exists in your character.  I feared early instilled prejudice: I wanted to have you safe before hazarding confidences.  This was cowardly: I should have appealed to your nobleness and magnanimity at first, as I do now--opened to you plainly my life of agony--described to you my hunger and thirst after a higher and worthier existence--shown to you, not my _resolution_ (that word is weak), but my resistless _bent_ to love faithfully and well, where I am faithfully and well loved in return.  Then I should have asked you to accept my pledge of fidelity and to give me yours.  Jane--give it me now.

7088-7088	Why are you silent, Jane?

7092-7092	Depart!

7093-7095	Jane, you understand what I want of you?  Just this promise--'I will be yours, Mr. Rochester.'

7096-7097	Mr. Rochester, I will _not_ be yours.

7099-7099	Jane!

7100-7100	Jane, do you mean to go one way in the world, and to let me go another?

7101-7101	I do.

2-2	Jane

7102-7102	do you mean it now?

7103-7103	I do.

7104-7104	And now?

2-2	I do,

7107-7109	Oh, Jane, this is bitter!  This--this is wicked.  It would not be wicked to love me.

7110-7110	It would to obey you.

7113-7119	One instant, Jane.  Give one glance to my horrible life when you are gone.  All happiness will be torn away with you.  What then is left?  For a wife I have but the maniac upstairs: as well might you refer me to some corpse in yonder churchyard.  What shall I do, Jane?  Where turn for a companion and for some hope?

7120-7122	Do as I do: trust in God and yourself.  Believe in heaven.  Hope to meet again there.

7123-7123	Then you will not yield?

7124-7124	No.

7125-7125	Then you condemn me to live wretched and to die accursed?

7127-7127	I advise you to live sinless, and I wish you to die tranquil.

7128-7129	Then you snatch love and innocence from me?  You fling me back on lust for a passion--vice for an occupation?

7130-7133	Mr. Rochester, I no more assign this fate to you than I grasp at it for myself.  We were born to strive and endure--you as well as I: do so.  You will forget me before I forget you.

7134-7138	You make me a liar by such language: you sully my honour.  I declared I could not change: you tell me to my face I shall change soon.  And what a distortion in your judgment, what a perversity in your ideas, is proved by your conduct!  Is it better to drive a fellow-creature to despair than to transgress a mere human law, no man being injured by the breach? for you have neither relatives nor acquaintances whom you need fear to offend by living with me?

7141-7141	Oh, comply!

7143-7145	Think of his misery; think of his danger--look at his state when left alone; remember his headlong nature; consider the recklessness following on despair--soothe him; save him; love him; tell him you love him and will be his.  Who in the world cares for _you_? or who will be injured by what you do?

7146-7153	_I_ care for myself.  The more solitary, the more friendless, the more unsustained I am, the more I will respect myself.  I will keep the law given by God; sanctioned by man.  I will hold to the principles received by me when I was sane, and not mad--as I am now.  Laws and principles are not for the times when there is no temptation: they are for such moments as this, when body and soul rise in mutiny against their rigour; stringent are they; inviolate they shall be.  If at my individual convenience I might break them, what would be their worth?  They have a worth--so I have always believed; and if I cannot believe it now, it is because I am insane--quite insane: with my veins running fire, and my heart beating faster than I can count its throbs.  Preconceived opinions, foregone determinations, are all I have at this hour to stand by: there I plant my foot.

2-2	Never,

7161-7162	never was anything at once so frail and so indomitable.  A mere reed she feels in my hand!

7164-7172	I could bend her with my finger and thumb: and what good would it do if I bent, if I uptore, if I crushed her?  Consider that eye: consider the resolute, wild, free thing looking out of it, defying me, with more than courage--with a stern triumph. Whatever I do with its cage, I cannot get at it--the savage, beautiful creature!  If I tear, if I rend the slight prison, my outrage will only let the captive loose.  Conqueror I might be of the house; but the inmate would escape to heaven before I could call myself possessor of its clay dwelling-place.  And it is you, spirit--with will and energy, and virtue and purity--that I want: not alone your brittle frame.  Of yourself you could come with soft flight and nestle against my heart, if you would: seized against your will, you will elude the grasp like an essence--you will vanish ere I inhale your fragrance.  Oh! come, Jane, come!

7176-7176	You are going, Jane?

7177-7177	I am going, sir.

7178-7178	You are leaving me?

7179-7179	Yes.

7180-7182	You will not come?  You will not be my comforter, my rescuer?  My deep love, my wild woe, my frantic prayer, are all nothing to you?

7184-7184	I am going.

7185-7185	Jane!

7186-7187	Mr. Rochester!

7188-7189	Withdraw, then,--I consent; but remember, you leave me here in anguish. Go up to your own room; think over all I have said, and, Jane, cast a glance on my sufferings--think of me.

7191-7192	Oh, Jane! my hope--my love--my life!

7197-7197	God bless you, my dear master!

7199-7199	God keep you from harm and wrong--direct you, solace you--reward you well for your past kindness to me.

2-2	Little Jane's love would have been my best reward,

7200-7201	without it, my heart is broken.  But Jane will give me her love: yes--nobly, generously.

7203-7203	Farewell!

7205-7205	Farewell for ever!

7213-7213	My daughter, flee temptation.

7214-7214	Mother, I will.

7216-7216	It cannot be too early to commence the task I have to fulfil,

7224-7225	Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!

7227-7227	Farewell, my darling Adele!

7234-7234	Mr. Rochester, I will love you and live with you through life till death,

7385-7385	if there were any dressmaker or plain-workwoman in the village?

7386-7387	Yes; two or three.  Quite as many as there was employment for.

7396-7396	Did she know of any place in the neighbourhood where a servant was wanted?

7397-7397	Nay; she couldn't say.

7398-7399	What was the chief trade in this place?  What did most of the people do?

7400-7401	Some were farm labourers; a good deal worked at Mr. Oliver's needle-factory, and at the foundry.

7402-7403	Did Mr. Oliver employ women?

7404-7404	Nay; it was men's work.

7405-7405	And what do the women do?

2-2	I knawn't,

7407-7408	Some does one thing, and some another. Poor folk mun get on as they can.

2-2	No,

7423-7423	we do not keep a servant.

7424-7424	Can you tell me where I could get employment of any kind?

7426-7427	I am a stranger, without acquaintance in this place.  I want some work: no matter what.

7429-7429	was sorry she could give me no information,

7444-7444	Yes.

7445-7445	Was the clergyman in?

7446-7446	No.

7447-7447	Would he be in soon?

7448-7448	No, he was gone from home.

7449-7449	To a distance?

7450-7451	Not so far--happen three mile.  He had been called away by the sudden death of his father: he was at Marsh End now, and would very likely stay there a fortnight longer.

7452-7452	Was there any lady of the house?

2-2	Nay, there was naught but her, and she was housekeeper;

7457-7457	Would she give me a roll for this handkerchief?

7458-7458	Nay, she never sold stuff i' that way.

7460-7460	How could she tell where I had got the handkerchief?

7462-7462	Would she take my gloves?

7463-7464	No! what could she do with them?

7475-7476	Will you give me a piece of bread? for I am very hungry.

7485-7485	Will you give me that?

7487-7487	Will you give me that?

7490-7490	Mother!

7491-7491	there is a woman wants me to give her these porridge.

2-2	Well lass,

7492-7493	give it her if she's a beggar.  T' pig doesn't want it.

2-2	My strength is quite failing me,

7497-7510	I feel I cannot go much farther.  Shall I be an outcast again this night?  While the rain descends so, must I lay my head on the cold, drenched ground?  I fear I cannot do otherwise: for who will receive me?  But it will be very dreadful, with this feeling of hunger, faintness, chill, and this sense of desolation--this total prostration of hope.  In all likelihood, though, I should die before morning.  And why cannot I reconcile myself to the prospect of death?  Why do I struggle to retain a valueless life? Because I know, or believe, Mr. Rochester is living: and then, to die of want and cold is a fate to which nature cannot submit passively.  Oh, Providence! sustain me a little longer!  Aid!--direct me!

2-2	Well, I would rather die yonder than in a street or on a frequented road,

7516-7516	And far better that crows and ravens--if any ravens there be in these regions--should pick my flesh from my bones, than that they should be prisoned in a workhouse coffin and moulder in a pauper's grave.

7524-7524	That is an _ignis fatuus_,

7526-7526	Is it, then, a bonfire just kindled?

7528-7528	It may be a candle in a house,

7529-7531	but if so, I can never reach it.  It is much too far away: and were it within a yard of me, what would it avail?  I should but knock at the door to have it shut in my face.

2-2	Listen, Diana,

7568-7568	Franz and old Daniel are together in the night-time, and Franz is telling a dream from which he has awakened in terror--listen!

2-2	That is strong,

7571-7571	I relish it.

7573-7575	'Da trat hervor Einer, anzusehen wie die Sternen Nacht.'  Good! good!

7577-7580	There you have a dim and mighty archangel fitly set before you!  The line is worth a hundred pages of fustian.  'Ich wage die Gedanken in der Schale meines Zornes und die Werke mit dem Gewichte meines Grimms.'  I like it!

7582-7582	Is there ony country where they talk i' that way?

7584-7584	Yes, Hannah--a far larger country than England, where they talk in no other way.

7585-7585	Well, for sure case, I knawn't how they can understand t' one t'other: and if either o' ye went there, ye could tell what they said, I guess?

7586-7587	We could probably tell something of what they said, but not all--for we are not as clever as you think us, Hannah.  We don't speak German, and we cannot read it without a dictionary to help us.

7588-7588	And what good does it do you?

7589-7589	We mean to teach it some time--or at least the elements, as they say; and then we shall get more money than we do now.

7590-7590	Varry like: but give ower studying; ye've done enough for to-night.

7591-7592	I think we have: at least I'm tired.  Mary, are you?

7593-7593	Mortally: after all, it's tough work fagging away at a language with no master but a lexicon.

7594-7596	It is, especially such a language as this crabbed but glorious Deutsch. I wonder when St. John will come home.

7597-7598	Surely he will not be long now: it is just ten (looking at a little gold watch she drew from her girdle).  It rains fast, Hannah: will you have the goodness to look at the fire in the parlour?

7600-7600	Ah, childer!

7601-7601	it fair troubles me to go into yond' room now: it looks so lonesome wi' the chair empty and set back in a corner.

2-2	But he is in a better place,

7603-7604	we shouldn't wish him here again.  And then, nobody need to have a quieter death nor he had.

7605-7605	You say he never mentioned us?

7607-7616	He hadn't time, bairn: he was gone in a minute, was your father.  He had been a bit ailing like the day before, but naught to signify; and when Mr. St. John asked if he would like either o' ye to be sent for, he fair laughed at him.  He began again with a bit of a heaviness in his head the next day--that is, a fortnight sin'--and he went to sleep and niver wakened: he wor a'most stark when your brother went into t' chamber and fand him.  Ah, childer! that's t' last o' t' old stock--for ye and Mr. St. John is like of different soart to them 'at's gone; for all your mother wor mich i' your way, and a'most as book-learned.  She wor the pictur' o' ye, Mary: Diana is more like your father.

2-2	Ye'll want your supper, I am sure,

7621-7623	and so will Mr. St. John when he comes in.

7631-7631	What do you want?

7633-7633	May I speak to your mistresses?

7635-7636	You had better tell me what you have to say to them.  Where do you come from?

7637-7637	I am a stranger.

7638-7638	What is your business here at this hour?

7639-7639	I want a night's shelter in an out-house or anywhere, and a morsel of bread to eat.

7641-7641	I'll give you a piece of bread,

7641-7642	but we can't take in a vagrant to lodge.  It isn't likely.

7643-7643	Do let me speak to your mistresses.

7644-7646	No, not I.  What can they do for you?  You should not be roving about now; it looks very ill.

7647-7648	But where shall I go if you drive me away?  What shall I do?

7649-7650	Oh, I'll warrant you know where to go and what to do.  Mind you don't do wrong, that's all.  Here is a penny; now go--

7651-7652	A penny cannot feed me, and I have no strength to go farther.  Don't shut the door:--oh, don't, for God's sake!

2-2	I must; the rain is driving in--

7653-7653	Tell the young ladies.  Let me see them--

7654-7656	Indeed, I will not.  You are not what you ought to be, or you wouldn't make such a noise.  Move off.

7657-7657	But I must die if I am turned away.

7658-7660	Not you.  I'm fear'd you have some ill plans agate, that bring you about folk's houses at this time o' night.  If you've any followers--housebreakers or such like--anywhere near, you may tell them we are not by ourselves in the house; we have a gentleman, and dogs, and guns.

2-2	I can but die,

7670-7671	and I believe in God.  Let me try to wait His will in silence.

2-2	All men must die,

7673-7673	but all are not condemned to meet a lingering and premature doom, such as yours would be if you perished here of want.

7674-7674	Who or what speaks?

7678-7680	Is it you, Mr. St. John?

7682-7682	Yes--yes; open quickly.

7683-7689	Well, how wet and cold you must be, such a wild night as it is!  Come in--your sisters are quite uneasy about you, and I believe there are bad folks about.  There has been a beggar-woman--I declare she is not gone yet!--laid down there.  Get up! for shame!  Move off, I say!

7690-7695	Hush, Hannah!  I have a word to say to the woman.  You have done your duty in excluding, now let me do mine in admitting her.  I was near, and listened to both you and her.  I think this is a peculiar case--I must at least examine into it.  Young woman, rise, and pass before me into the house.

7702-7703	St. John, who is it?

2-2	I cannot tell: I found her at the door,

2-2	She does look white,

2-2	As white as clay or death,

7708-7708	She will fall: let her sit.

7711-7714	Perhaps a little water would restore her.  Hannah, fetch some.  But she is worn to nothing.  How very thin, and how very bloodless!

7715-7715	A mere spectre!

7716-7716	Is she ill, or only famished?

7717-7719	Famished, I think.  Hannah, is that milk?  Give it me, and a piece of bread.

7722-7722	Try to eat.

2-2	Yes--try,

2-2	Not too much at first--restrain her,

7725-7725	she has had enough.

7727-7728	A little more, St. John--look at the avidity in her eyes.

7729-7730	No more at present, sister.  Try if she can speak now--ask her her name.

7731-7731	My name is Jane Elliott.

7733-7734	And where do you live?  Where are your friends?

7736-7736	Can we send for any one you know?

7738-7738	What account can you give of yourself?

7743-7743	Sir, I can give you no details to-night.

2-2	But what, then,

7744-7744	do you expect me to do for you?

2-2	Nothing,

2-2	Do you mean,

7747-7748	that we have now given you what aid you require? and that we may dismiss you to the moor and the rainy night?

7752-7754	I will trust you.  If I were a masterless and stray dog, I know that you would not turn me from your hearth to-night: as it is, I really have no fear.  Do with me and for me as you like; but excuse me from much discourse--my breath is short--I feel a spasm when I speak.

2-2	Hannah,

7758-7759	let her sit there at present, and ask her no questions; in ten minutes more, give her the remainder of that milk and bread.  Mary and Diana, let us go into the parlour and talk the matter over.

7776-7776	It is very well we took her in.

7777-7778	Yes; she would certainly have been found dead at the door in the morning had she been left out all night.  I wonder what she has gone through?

7779-7779	Strange hardships, I imagine--poor, emaciated, pallid wanderer?

7780-7780	She is not an uneducated person, I should think, by her manner of speaking; her accent was quite pure; and the clothes she took off, though splashed and wet, were little worn and fine.

7781-7781	She has a peculiar face; fleshless and haggard as it is, I rather like it; and when in good health and animated, I can fancy her physiognomy would be agreeable.

7791-7791	Rather an unusual physiognomy; certainly, not indicative of vulgarity or degradation.

2-2	Far otherwise,

7793-7795	To speak truth, St. John, my heart rather warms to the poor little soul.  I wish we may be able to benefit her permanently.

2-2	That is hardly likely,

7797-7798	You will find she is some young lady who has had a misunderstanding with her friends, and has probably injudiciously left them.  We may, perhaps, succeed in restoring her to them, if she is not obstinate: but I trace lines of force in her face which make me sceptical of her tractability.

7799-7799	She looks sensible, but not at all handsome.

7800-7801	She is so ill, St. John.

7802-7803	Ill or well, she would always be plain.  The grace and harmony of beauty are quite wanting in those features.

7823-7823	What, you have got up!

7825-7826	You are better, then.  You may sit you down in my chair on the hearthstone, if you will.

7829-7829	Did you ever go a-begging afore you came here?

7830-7831	You are mistaken in supposing me a beggar.  I am no beggar; any more than yourself or your young ladies.

7832-7832	I dunnut understand that: you've like no house, nor no brass, I guess?

7833-7833	The want of house or brass (by which I suppose you mean money) does not make a beggar in your sense of the word.

7834-7834	Are you book-learned?

7836-7836	Yes, very.

7837-7837	But you've never been to a boarding-school?

7838-7838	I was at a boarding-school eight years.

7840-7840	Whatever cannot ye keep yourself for, then?

7841-7842	I have kept myself; and, I trust, shall keep myself again.  What are you going to do with these gooseberries?

7844-7844	Mak' 'em into pies.

7845-7845	Give them to me and I'll pick them.

7846-7846	Nay; I dunnut want ye to do nought.

7847-7848	But I must do something.  Let me have them.

2-2	lest,

7849-7849	I should mucky it.

2-2	Ye've not been used to sarvant's wark, I see by your hands,

7851-7851	Happen ye've been a dressmaker?

7852-7853	No, you are wrong.  And now, never mind what I have been: don't trouble your head further about me; but tell me the name of the house where we are.

7854-7854	Some calls it Marsh End, and some calls it Moor House.

7855-7857	And the gentleman who lives here is called Mr. St. John?

7858-7859	Nay; he doesn't live here: he is only staying a while.  When he is at home, he is in his own parish at Morton.

7860-7860	That village a few miles off?

7861-7861	Aye.

7862-7862	And what is he?

7863-7863	He is a parson.

7865-7865	This, then, was his father's residence?

7866-7867	Aye; old Mr. Rivers lived here, and his father, and grandfather, and gurt (great) grandfather afore him.

7868-7870	The name, then, of that gentleman, is Mr. St. John Rivers?

7871-7872	Aye; St. John is like his kirstened name.

7873-7873	And his sisters are called Diana and Mary Rivers?

7874-7874	Yes.

7875-7875	Their father is dead?

7876-7876	Dead three weeks sin' of a stroke.

7877-7877	They have no mother?

7878-7878	The mistress has been dead this mony a year.

7879-7879	Have you lived with the family long?

7880-7881	I've lived here thirty year.  I nursed them all three.

7882-7883	That proves you must have been an honest and faithful servant.  I will say so much for you, though you have had the incivility to call me a beggar.

7885-7885	I believe,

7885-7885	I was quite mista'en in my thoughts of you: but there is so mony cheats goes about, you mun forgie me.

2-2	And though,

7886-7886	you wished to turn me from the door, on a night when you should not have shut out a dog.

7887-7890	Well, it was hard: but what can a body do?  I thought more o' th' childer nor of mysel: poor things!  They've like nobody to tak' care on 'em but me.  I'm like to look sharpish.

2-2	You munnut think too hardly of me,

2-2	But I do think hardly of you,

7893-7894	and I'll tell you why--not so much because you refused to give me shelter, or regarded me as an impostor, as because you just now made it a species of reproach that I had no 'brass' and no house.  Some of the best people that ever lived have been as destitute as I am; and if you are a Christian, you ought not to consider poverty a crime.

2-2	No more I ought,

7895-7898	Mr. St. John tells me so too; and I see I wor wrang--but I've clear a different notion on you now to what I had. You look a raight down dacent little crater.

7899-7900	That will do--I forgive you now.  Shake hands.

7903-7903	the childer,

7906-7908	aboon two hundred year old--for all it looked but a small, humble place, naught to compare wi' Mr. Oliver's grand hall down i' Morton Vale.  But she could remember Bill Oliver's father a journeyman needlemaker; and th' Rivers wor gentry i' th' owd days o' th' Henrys, as onybody might see by looking into th' registers i' Morton Church vestry.

7909-7909	the owd maister was like other folk--naught mich out o' t' common way: stark mad o' shooting, and farming, and sich like.

7911-7911	bairns

7912-7912	of a mak' of their own.

7917-7917	threaped.

7920-7920	Gone over to Morton for a walk; but they would be back in half-an-hour to tea.

2-2	You should have waited for my leave to descend,

7926-7928	You still look very pale--and so thin!  Poor child!--poor girl!

7935-7935	And what business have you here?

7937-7938	It is not your place. Mary and I sit in the kitchen sometimes, because at home we like to be free, even to license--but you are a visitor, and must go into the parlour.

7939-7939	I am very well here.

7940-7940	Not at all, with Hannah bustling about and covering you with flour.

2-2	Besides, the fire is too hot for you,

2-2	To be sure,

7943-7943	Come, you must be obedient.

2-2	Sit there,

7945-7945	while we take our things off and get the tea ready; it is another privilege we exercise in our little moorland home--to prepare our own meals when we are so inclined, or when Hannah is baking, brewing, washing, or ironing.

2-2	Eat that now,

7967-7968	you must be hungry.  Hannah says you have had nothing but some gruel since breakfast.

2-2	You are very hungry,

7974-7974	I am, sir.

7976-7977	It is well for you that a low fever has forced you to abstain for the last three days: there would have been danger in yielding to the cravings of your appetite at first.  Now you may eat, though still not immoderately.

2-2	I trust I shall not eat long at your expense, sir,

2-2	No,

7979-7979	when you have indicated to us the residence of your friends, we can write to them, and you may be restored to home.

7980-7980	That, I must plainly tell you, is out of my power to do; being absolutely without home and friends.

2-2	Do you mean to say,

7986-7986	that you are completely isolated from every connection?

7987-7988	I do.  Not a tie links me to any living thing: not a claim do I possess to admittance under any roof in England.

7989-7989	A most singular position at your age!

7992-7993	You have never been married?  You are a spinster?

7995-7995	Why, she can't be above seventeen or eighteen years old, St. John,

7997-7998	I am near nineteen: but I am not married.  No.

8002-8002	Where did you last reside?

8004-8004	You are too inquisitive, St. John,

2-2	The name of the place where, and of the person with whom I lived, is my secret,

8007-8007	Which, if you like, you have, in my opinion, a right to keep, both from St. John and every other questioner,

2-2	Yet if I know nothing about you or your history, I cannot help you,

8010-8010	And you need help, do you not?

8011-8011	I need it, and I seek it so far, sir, that some true philanthropist will put me in the way of getting work which I can do, and the remuneration for which will keep me, if but in the barest necessaries of life.

8012-8013	I know not whether I am a true philanthropist; yet I am willing to aid you to the utmost of my power in a purpose so honest.  First, then, tell me what you have been accustomed to do, and what you _can_ do.

8016-8016	Mr. Rivers,

8017-8019	you and your sisters have done me a great service--the greatest man can do his fellow-being; you have rescued me, by your noble hospitality, from death.  This benefit conferred gives you an unlimited claim on my gratitude, and a claim, to a certain extent, on my confidence.  I will tell you as much of the history of the wanderer you have harboured, as I can tell without compromising my own peace of mind--my own security, moral and physical, and that of others.

8020-8026	I am an orphan, the daughter of a clergyman.  My parents died before I could know them.  I was brought up a dependant; educated in a charitable institution.  I will even tell you the name of the establishment, where I passed six years as a pupil, and two as a teacher--Lowood Orphan Asylum, ---shire: you will have heard of it, Mr. Rivers?--the Rev. Robert Brocklehurst is the treasurer.

8027-8028	I have heard of Mr. Brocklehurst, and I have seen the school.

8029-8039	I left Lowood nearly a year since to become a private governess.  I obtained a good situation, and was happy.  This place I was obliged to leave four days before I came here.  The reason of my departure I cannot and ought not to explain: it would be useless, dangerous, and would sound incredible.  No blame attached to me: I am as free from culpability as any one of you three.  Miserable I am, and must be for a time; for the catastrophe which drove me from a house I had found a paradise was of a strange and direful nature.  I observed but two points in planning my departure--speed, secrecy: to secure these, I had to leave behind me everything I possessed except a small parcel; which, in my hurry and trouble of mind, I forgot to take out of the coach that brought me to Whitcross.  To this neighbourhood, then, I came, quite destitute.  I slept two nights in the open air, and wandered about two days without crossing a threshold: but twice in that space of time did I taste food; and it was when brought by hunger, exhaustion, and despair almost to the last gasp, that you, Mr. Rivers, forbade me to perish of want at your door, and took me under the shelter of your roof.  I know all your sisters have done for me since--for I have not been insensible during my seeming torpor--and I owe to their spontaneous, genuine, genial compassion as large a debt as to your evangelical charity.

8040-8040	Don't make her talk any more now, St. John,

8041-8042	she is evidently not yet fit for excitement.  Come to the sofa and sit down now, Miss Elliott.

8046-8046	You said your name was Jane Elliott?

8048-8048	I did say so; and it is the name by which I think it expedient to be called at present, but it is not my real name, and when I hear it, it sounds strange to me.

8049-8049	Your real name you will not give?

8050-8050	No: I fear discovery above all things; and whatever disclosure would lead to it, I avoid.

2-2	You are quite right, I am sure,

8052-8052	Now do, brother, let her be at peace a while.

8055-8055	You would not like to be long dependent on our hospitality--you would wish, I see, to dispense as soon as may be with my sisters' compassion, and, above all, with my _charity_ (I am quite sensible of the distinction drawn, nor do I resent it--it is just): you desire to be independent of us?

8056-8057	I do: I have already said so.  Show me how to work, or how to seek work: that is all I now ask; then let me go, if it be but to the meanest cottage; but till then, allow me to stay here: I dread another essay of the horrors of homeless destitution.

2-2	Indeed you _shall_ stay here,

8059-8059	You _shall_,

2-2	My sisters, you see, have a pleasure in keeping you,

8062-8065	as they would have a pleasure in keeping and cherishing a half-frozen bird, some wintry wind might have driven through their casement.  I feel more inclination to put you in the way of keeping yourself, and shall endeavour to do so; but observe, my sphere is narrow.  I am but the incumbent of a poor country parish: my aid must be of the humblest sort. And if you are inclined to despise the day of small things, seek some more efficient succour than such as I can offer.

2-2	She has already said that she is willing to do anything honest she can do,

8066-8067	and you know, St. John, she has no choice of helpers: she is forced to put up with such crusty people as you.

2-2	I will be a dressmaker; I will be a plain-workwoman; I will be a servant, a nurse-girl, if I can be no better,

2-2	Right,

8072-8072	If such is your spirit, I promise to aid you, in my own time and way.

8108-8108	And if I let a gust of wind or a sprinkling of rain turn me aside from these easy tasks, what preparation would such sloth be for the future I propose to myself?

8132-8132	You have a question to ask of me?

8134-8134	Yes; I wish to know whether you have heard of any service I can offer myself to undertake?

8135-8135	I found or devised something for you three weeks ago; but as you seemed both useful and happy here--as my sisters had evidently become attached to you, and your society gave them unusual pleasure--I deemed it inexpedient to break in on your mutual comfort till their approaching departure from Marsh End should render yours necessary.

8136-8136	And they will go in three days now?

8138-8138	Yes; and when they go, I shall return to the parsonage at Morton: Hannah will accompany me; and this old house will be shut up.

8141-8143	What is the employment you had in view, Mr. Rivers?  I hope this delay will not have increased the difficulty of securing it.

8144-8144	Oh, no; since it is an employment which depends only on me to give, and you to accept.

2-2	You need be in no hurry to hear,

8147-8151	let me frankly tell you, I have nothing eligible or profitable to suggest.  Before I explain, recall, if you please, my notice, clearly given, that if I helped you, it must be as the blind man would help the lame.  I am poor; for I find that, when I have paid my father's debts, all the patrimony remaining to me will be this crumbling grange, the row of scathed firs behind, and the patch of moorish soil, with the yew-trees and holly-bushes in front.  I am obscure: Rivers is an old name; but of the three sole descendants of the race, two earn the dependant's crust among strangers, and the third considers himself an alien from his native country--not only for life, but in death.  Yes, and deems, and is bound to deem, himself honoured by the lot, and aspires but after the day when the cross of separation from fleshly ties shall be laid on his shoulders, and when the Head of that church-militant of whose humblest members he is one, shall give the word, 'Rise, follow Me!'

8154-8157	And since I am myself poor and obscure, I can offer you but a service of poverty and obscurity.  _You_ may even think it degrading--for I see now your habits have been what the world calls refined: your tastes lean to the ideal, and your society has at least been amongst the educated; but _I_ consider that no service degrades which can better our race.  I hold that the more arid and unreclaimed the soil where the Christian labourer's task of tillage is appointed him--the scantier the meed his toil brings--the higher the honour.  His, under such circumstances, is the destiny of the pioneer; and the first pioneers of the Gospel were the Apostles--their captain was Jesus, the Redeemer, Himself.

8158-8158	Well?

8159-8159	proceed.

2-2	I believe you will accept the post I offer you,

8162-8162	and hold it for a while: not permanently, though: any more than I could permanently keep the narrow and narrowing--the tranquil, hidden office of English country incumbent; for in your nature is an alloy as detrimental to repose as that in mine, though of a different kind.

2-2	Do explain,

8164-8173	I will; and you shall hear how poor the proposal is,--how trivial--how cramping.  I shall not stay long at Morton, now that my father is dead, and that I am my own master.  I shall leave the place probably in the course of a twelve-month; but while I do stay, I will exert myself to the utmost for its improvement.  Morton, when I came to it two years ago, had no school: the children of the poor were excluded from every hope of progress.  I established one for boys: I mean now to open a second school for girls.  I have hired a building for the purpose, with a cottage of two rooms attached to it for the mistress's house.  Her salary will be thirty pounds a year: her house is already furnished, very simply, but sufficiently, by the kindness of a lady, Miss Oliver; the only daughter of the sole rich man in my parish--Mr. Oliver, the proprietor of a needle- factory and iron-foundry in the valley.  The same lady pays for the education and clothing of an orphan from the workhouse, on condition that she shall aid the mistress in such menial offices connected with her own house and the school as her occupation of teaching will prevent her having time to discharge in person.  Will you be this mistress?

8176-8177	I thank you for the proposal, Mr. Rivers, and I accept it with all my heart.

8178-8178	But you comprehend me?

8180-8183	It is a village school: your scholars will be only poor girls--cottagers' children--at the best, farmers' daughters.  Knitting, sewing, reading, writing, ciphering, will be all you will have to teach.  What will you do with your accomplishments? What, with the largest portion of your mind--sentiments--tastes?

8184-8185	Save them till they are wanted.  They will keep.

8186-8186	You know what you undertake, then?

8187-8187	I do.

8189-8189	And when will you commence the exercise of your function?

8190-8190	I will go to my house to-morrow, and open the school, if you like, next week.

8191-8191	Very well: so be it.

8195-8196	What do you disapprove of, Mr. Rivers?

8198-8198	You will not stay at Morton long: no, no!

8199-8200	Why?  What is your reason for saying so?

8201-8201	I read it in your eye; it is not of that description which promises the maintenance of an even tenor in life.

8202-8202	I am not ambitious.

8203-8203	ambitious.

8204-8207	No.  What made you think of ambition?  Who is ambitious?  I know I am: but how did you find it out?

8208-8208	I was speaking of myself.

2-2	Well, if you are not ambitious, you are--

8210-8210	What?

8211-8212	I was going to say, impassioned: but perhaps you would have misunderstood the word, and been displeased.  I mean, that human affections and sympathies have a most powerful hold on you.  I am sure you cannot long be content to pass your leisure in solitude, and to devote your working hours to a monotonous labour wholly void of stimulus: any more than I can be content,

8213-8216	to live here buried in morass, pent in with mountains--my nature, that God gave me, contravened; my faculties, heaven-bestowed, paralysed--made useless.  You hear now how I contradict myself.  I, who preached contentment with a humble lot, and justified the vocation even of hewers of wood and drawers of water in God's service--I, His ordained minister, almost rave in my restlessness.  Well, propensities and principles must be reconciled by some means.

2-2	He will sacrifice all to his long-framed resolves,

8224-8228	natural affection and feelings more potent still.  St. John looks quiet, Jane; but he hides a fever in his vitals.  You would think him gentle, yet in some things he is inexorable as death; and the worst of it is, my conscience will hardly permit me to dissuade him from his severe decision: certainly, I cannot for a moment blame him for it.  It is right, noble, Christian: yet it breaks my heart!

2-2	We are now without father: we shall soon be without home and brother,

2-2	misfortunes never come singly,

2-2	Our uncle John is dead,

8238-8238	Dead?

8240-8240	Yes.

8242-8242	And what then?

8244-8244	What then, Die?

8246-8248	What then?  Why--nothing.  Read.

8253-8253	Amen!  We can yet live,

2-2	At any rate, it makes us no worse off than we were before,

2-2	Only it forces rather strongly on the mind the picture of what _might have been_,

8257-8257	and contrasts it somewhat too vividly with what _is_.

2-2	Jane, you will wonder at us and our mysteries,

8261-8272	and think us hard-hearted beings not to be more moved at the death of so near a relation as an uncle; but we have never seen him or known him.  He was my mother's brother.  My father and he quarrelled long ago.  It was by his advice that my father risked most of his property in the speculation that ruined him.  Mutual recrimination passed between them: they parted in anger, and were never reconciled.  My uncle engaged afterwards in more prosperous undertakings: it appears he realised a fortune of twenty thousand pounds.  He was never married, and had no near kindred but ourselves and one other person, not more closely related than we.  My father always cherished the idea that he would atone for his error by leaving his possessions to us; that letter informs us that he has bequeathed every penny to the other relation, with the exception of thirty guineas, to be divided between St. John, Diana, and Mary Rivers, for the purchase of three mourning rings.  He had a right, of course, to do as he pleased: and yet a momentary damp is cast on the spirits by the receipt of such news.  Mary and I would have esteemed ourselves rich with a thousand pounds each; and to St. John such a sum would have been valuable, for the good it would have enabled him to do.

8313-8313	The air was mild, the dew was balm.

8323-8324	No, I cannot stay; I have only brought you a little parcel my sisters left for you.  I think it contains a colour-box, pencils, and paper.

8327-8327	Have you found your first day's work harder than you expected?

8329-8330	Oh, no!  On the contrary, I think in time I shall get on with my scholars very well.

8331-8331	But perhaps your accommodations--your cottage--your furniture--have disappointed your expectations?  They are, in truth, scanty enough; but--

8332-8336	My cottage is clean and weather-proof; my furniture sufficient and commodious.  All I see has made me thankful, not despondent.  I am not absolutely such a fool and sensualist as to regret the absence of a carpet, a sofa, and silver plate; besides, five weeks ago I had nothing--I was an outcast, a beggar, a vagrant; now I have acquaintance, a home, a business.  I wonder at the goodness of God; the generosity of my friends; the bounty of my lot.  I do not repine.

8337-8338	But you feel solitude an oppression?  The little house there behind you is dark and empty.

8339-8339	I have hardly had time yet to enjoy a sense of tranquillity, much less to grow impatient under one of loneliness.

8340-8341	Very well; I hope you feel the content you express: at any rate, your good sense will tell you that it is too soon yet to yield to the vacillating fears of Lot's wife.  What you had left before I saw you, of course I do not know; but I counsel you to resist firmly every temptation which would incline you to look back: pursue your present career steadily, for some months at least.

2-2	It is what I mean to do,

8344-8345	It is hard work to control the workings of inclination and turn the bent of nature; but that it may be done, I know from experience.  God has given us, in a measure, the power to make our own fate; and when our energies seem to demand a sustenance they cannot get--when our will strains after a path we may not follow--we need neither starve from inanition, nor stand still in despair: we have but to seek another nourishment for the mind, as strong as the forbidden food it longed to taste--and perhaps purer; and to hew out for the adventurous foot a road as direct and broad as the one Fortune has blocked up against us, if rougher than it.

8346-8350	A year ago I was myself intensely miserable, because I thought I had made a mistake in entering the ministry: its uniform duties wearied me to death.  I burnt for the more active life of the world--for the more exciting toils of a literary career--for the destiny of an artist, author, orator; anything rather than that of a priest: yes, the heart of a politician, of a soldier, of a votary of glory, a lover of renown, a luster after power, beat under my curate's surplice.  I considered; my life was so wretched, it must be changed, or I must die.  After a season of darkness and struggling, light broke and relief fell: my cramped existence all at once spread out to a plain without bounds--my powers heard a call from heaven to rise, gather their full strength, spread their wings, and mount beyond ken.  God had an errand for me; to bear which afar, to deliver it well, skill and strength, courage and eloquence, the best qualifications of soldier, statesman, and orator, were all needed: for these all centre in the good missionary.

8351-8353	A missionary I resolved to be.  From that moment my state of mind changed; the fetters dissolved and dropped from every faculty, leaving nothing of bondage but its galling soreness--which time only can heal.  My father, indeed, imposed the determination, but since his death, I have not a legitimate obstacle to contend with; some affairs settled, a successor for Morton provided, an entanglement or two of the feelings broken through or cut asunder--a last conflict with human weakness, in which I know I shall overcome, because I have vowed that I _will_ overcome--and I leave Europe for the East.

8356-8359	Good evening, Mr. Rivers.  And good evening, old Carlo.  Your dog is quicker to recognise his friends than you are, sir; he pricked his ears and wagged his tail when I was at the bottom of the field, and you have your back towards me now.

2-2	A lovely evening, but late for you to be out alone,

2-2	Oh, I only came home from S-

8375-8376	this afternoon.  Papa told me you had opened your school, and that the new mistress was come; and so I put on my bonnet after tea, and ran up the valley to see her: this is she?

2-2	It is,

8380-8380	Do you think you shall like Morton?

8382-8383	I hope I shall.  I have many inducements to do so.

8384-8384	Did you find your scholars as attentive as you expected?

8385-8385	Quite.

8386-8386	Do you like your house?

8387-8387	Very much.

8388-8388	Have I furnished it nicely?

8389-8389	Very nicely, indeed.

8390-8390	And made a good choice of an attendant for you in Alice Wood?

8391-8392	You have indeed.  She is teachable and handy.

2-2	I shall come up and help you to teach sometimes,

8396-8400	It will be a change for me to visit you now and then; and I like a change.  Mr. Rivers, I have been _so_ gay during my stay at S-.  Last night, or rather this morning, I was dancing till two o'clock.  The ---th regiment are stationed there since the riots; and the officers are the most agreeable men in the world: they put all our young knife-grinders and scissor merchants to shame.

8409-8409	Poor Carlo loves me,

8410-8410	_He_ is not stern and distant to his friends; and if he could speak, he would not be silent.

2-2	Papa says you never come to see us now,

8418-8419	You are quite a stranger at Vale Hall.  He is alone this evening, and not very well: will you return with me and visit him?

8420-8420	It is not a seasonable hour to intrude on Mr. Oliver,

8423-8428	Not a seasonable hour!  But I declare it is.  It is just the hour when papa most wants company: when the works are closed and he has no business to occupy him.  Now, Mr. Rivers, _do_ come.  Why are you so very shy, and so very sombre?

8430-8430	I forgot!

8432-8437	I am so giddy and thoughtless!  _Do_ excuse me.  It had slipped my memory that you have good reasons to be indisposed for joining in my chatter.  Diana and Mary have left you, and Moor House is shut up, and you are so lonely.  I am sure I pity you.  Do come and see papa.

8438-8438	Not to-night, Miss Rosamond, not to-night.

8442-8443	Well, if you are so obstinate, I will leave you; for I dare not stay any longer: the dew begins to fall.  Good evening!

8446-8446	Good evening!

8449-8449	Are you well?

2-2	Quite well,

8456-8456	inexorable as death.

8473-8473	sitting in sunshine, calm and sweet;

8491-8495	I love you, and I know you prefer me.  It is not despair of success that keeps me dumb.  If I offered my heart, I believe you would accept it.  But that heart is already laid on a sacred altar: the fire is arranged round it. It will soon be no more than a sacrifice consumed.

8511-8511	not one-tenth so handsome, though I was a nice neat little soul enough, but he was an angel.

8516-8520	Had I done these pictures?  Did I know French and German?  What a love--what a miracle I was!  I drew better than her master in the first school in S-.  Would I sketch a portrait of her, to show to papa?

2-2	With pleasure,

2-2	Indeed,

8534-8534	she is clever enough to be a governess in a high family, papa.

2-2	I am come to see how you are spending your holiday,

8554-8556	Not, I hope, in thought?  No, that is well: while you draw you will not feel lonely.  You see, I mistrust you still, though you have borne up wonderfully so far.  I have brought you a book for evening solace,

2-2	Marmion

4-4	Marmion

2-2	With all his firmness and self-control,

8575-8576	he tasks himself too far: locks every feeling and pang within--expresses, confesses, imparts nothing.  I am sure it would benefit him to talk a little about this sweet Rosamond, whom he thinks he ought not to marry: I will make him talk.

8577-8578	Take a chair, Mr. Rivers.

8580-8580	Very well,

8580-8581	stand if you like; but you shall not go just yet, I am determined: solitude is at least as bad for you as it is for me.  I'll try if I cannot discover the secret spring of your confidence, and find an aperture in that marble breast through which I can shed one drop of the balm of sympathy.

8582-8582	Is this portrait like?

8584-8586	Like!  Like whom?  I did not observe it closely.

8587-8588	You did, Mr. Rivers.

8590-8590	Oh, that is nothing yet,

8591-8591	I don't mean to be baffled by a little stiffness on your part; I'm prepared to go to considerable lengths.

8593-8593	You observed it closely and distinctly; but I have no objection to your looking at it again,

2-2	A well-executed picture,

8593-8593	very soft, clear colouring; very graceful and correct drawing.

8594-8596	Yes, yes; I know all that.  But what of the resemblance?  Who is it like?

8597-8597	Miss Oliver, I presume.

8598-8600	Of course.  And now, sir, to reward you for the accurate guess, I will promise to paint you a careful and faithful duplicate of this very picture, provided you admit that the gift would be acceptable to you.  I don't wish to throw away my time and trouble on an offering you would deem worthless.

8602-8602	It is like!

8603-8604	the eye is well managed: the colour, light, expression, are perfect.  It smiles!

8605-8608	Would it comfort, or would it wound you to have a similar painting?  Tell me that.  When you are at Madagascar, or at the Cape, or in India, would it be a consolation to have that memento in your possession? or would the sight of it bring recollections calculated to enervate and distress?

8610-8610	That I should like to have it is certain: whether it would be judicious or wise is another question.

8615-8615	As far as I can see, it would be wiser and more judicious if you were to take to yourself the original at once.

8617-8617	burst

8619-8619	the silent sea

2-2	She likes you, I am sure,

8621-8623	and her father respects you.  Moreover, she is a sweet girl--rather thoughtless; but you would have sufficient thought for both yourself and her.  You ought to marry her.

8624-8624	_Does_ she like me?

8626-8627	Certainly; better than she likes any one else.  She talks of you continually: there is no subject she enjoys so much or touches upon so often.

2-2	It is very pleasant to hear this,

8628-8628	very: go on for another quarter of an hour.

2-2	But where is the use of going on,

8630-8630	when you are probably preparing some iron blow of contradiction, or forging a fresh chain to fetter your heart?

8631-8636	Don't imagine such hard things.  Fancy me yielding and melting, as I am doing: human love rising like a freshly opened fountain in my mind and overflowing with sweet inundation all the field I have so carefully and with such labour prepared--so assiduously sown with the seeds of good intentions, of self-denying plans.  And now it is deluged with a nectarous flood--the young germs swamped--delicious poison cankering them: now I see myself stretched on an ottoman in the drawing-room at Vale Hall at my bride Rosamond Oliver's feet: she is talking to me with her sweet voice--gazing down on me with those eyes your skilful hand has copied so well--smiling at me with these coral lips.  She is mine--I am hers--this present life and passing world suffice to me.  Hush! say nothing--my heart is full of delight--my senses are entranced--let the time I marked pass in peace.

2-2	Now,

8639-8642	that little space was given to delirium and delusion.  I rested my temples on the breast of temptation, and put my neck voluntarily under her yoke of flowers.  I tasted her cup.  The pillow was burning: there is an asp in the garland: the wine has a bitter taste: her promises are hollow--her offers false: I see and know all this.

2-2	It is strange,

8644-8645	that while I love Rosamond Oliver so wildly--with all the intensity, indeed, of a first passion, the object of which is exquisitely beautiful, graceful, fascinating--I experience at the same time a calm, unwarped consciousness that she would not make me a good wife; that she is not the partner suited to me; that I should discover this within a year after marriage; and that to twelve months' rapture would succeed a lifetime of regret.  This I know.

8646-8646	Strange indeed!

2-2	While something in me,

8648-8651	is acutely sensible to her charms, something else is as deeply impressed with her defects: they are such that she could sympathise in nothing I aspired to--co-operate in nothing I undertook.  Rosamond a sufferer, a labourer, a female apostle?  Rosamond a missionary's wife?  No!

8652-8653	But you need not be a missionary.  You might relinquish that scheme.

8654-8662	Relinquish!  What! my vocation?  My great work?  My foundation laid on earth for a mansion in heaven?  My hopes of being numbered in the band who have merged all ambitions in the glorious one of bettering their race--of carrying knowledge into the realms of ignorance--of substituting peace for war--freedom for bondage--religion for superstition--the hope of heaven for the fear of hell?  Must I relinquish that?  It is dearer than the blood in my veins.  It is what I have to look forward to, and to live for.

8663-8664	And Miss Oliver?  Are her disappointment and sorrow of no interest to you?

8665-8666	Miss Oliver is ever surrounded by suitors and flatterers: in less than a month, my image will be effaced from her heart.  She will forget me; and will marry, probably, some one who will make her far happier than I should do.

8667-8668	You speak coolly enough; but you suffer in the conflict.  You are wasting away.

8669-8671	No.  If I get a little thin, it is with anxiety about my prospects, yet unsettled--my departure, continually procrastinated.  Only this morning, I received intelligence that the successor, whose arrival I have been so long expecting, cannot be ready to replace me for three months to come yet; and perhaps the three months may extend to six.

8672-8672	You tremble and become flushed whenever Miss Oliver enters the schoolroom.

2-2	You are original,

8677-8685	and not timid.  There is something brave in your spirit, as well as penetrating in your eye; but allow me to assure you that you partially misinterpret my emotions.  You think them more profound and potent than they are.  You give me a larger allowance of sympathy than I have a just claim to.  When I colour, and when I shade before Miss Oliver, I do not pity myself.  I scorn the weakness.  I know it is ignoble: a mere fever of the flesh: not, I declare, the convulsion of the soul.  _That_ is just as fixed as a rock, firm set in the depths of a restless sea.  Know me to be what I am--a cold hard man.

2-2	You have taken my confidence by storm,

8687-8692	and now it is much at your service.  I am simply, in my original state--stripped of that blood-bleached robe with which Christianity covers human deformity--a cold, hard, ambitious man.  Natural affection only, of all the sentiments, has permanent power over me.  Reason, and not feeling, is my guide; my ambition is unlimited: my desire to rise higher, to do more than others, insatiable.  I honour endurance, perseverance, industry, talent; because these are the means by which men achieve great ends and mount to lofty eminence.  I watch your career with interest, because I consider you a specimen of a diligent, orderly, energetic woman: not because I deeply compassionate what you have gone through, or what you still suffer.

2-2	You would describe yourself as a mere pagan philosopher,

8694-8704	No.  There is this difference between me and deistic philosophers: I believe; and I believe the Gospel.  You missed your epithet.  I am not a pagan, but a Christian philosopher--a follower of the sect of Jesus.  As His disciple I adopt His pure, His merciful, His benignant doctrines.  I advocate them: I am sworn to spread them.  Won in youth to religion, she has cultivated my original qualities thus:--From the minute germ, natural affection, she has developed the overshadowing tree, philanthropy.  From the wild stringy root of human uprightness, she has reared a due sense of the Divine justice.  Of the ambition to win power and renown for my wretched self, she has formed the ambition to spread my Master's kingdom; to achieve victories for the standard of the cross.  So much has religion done for me; turning the original materials to the best account; pruning and training nature.  But she could not eradicate nature: nor will it be eradicated 'till this mortal shall put on immortality.'

2-2	She _is_ lovely,

8708-8708	She is well named the Rose of the World, indeed!

8709-8709	And may I not paint one like it for you?

8710-8711	_Cui bono_?  No.

8716-8716	What is the matter?

2-2	Nothing in the world,

8719-8719	good-afternoon,

8720-8720	Well!

8721-8721	that caps the globe, however!

8725-8725	Marmion,

2-2	Day set on Norham's castled steep,    And Tweed's fair river broad and deep,       And Cheviot's mountains lone;    The massive towers, the donjon keep,    The flanking walls that round them sweep,       In yellow lustre shone

8733-8733	Any ill news?

8735-8735	Has anything happened?

8736-8737	No.  How very easily alarmed you are!

2-2	I shall sully the purity of your floor,

8740-8740	but you must excuse me for once.

8742-8742	I have had hard work to get here, I assure you,

8743-8743	One drift took me up to the waist; happily the snow is quite soft yet.

8744-8744	But why are you come?

8746-8747	Rather an inhospitable question to put to a visitor; but since you ask it, I answer simply to have a little talk with you; I got tired of my mute books and empty rooms.  Besides, since yesterday I have experienced the excitement of a person to whom a tale has been half-told, and who is impatient to hear the sequel.

8753-8753	I wish Diana or Mary would come and live with you: it is too bad that you should be quite alone; and you are recklessly rash about your own health.

2-2	Not at all,

8754-8756	I care for myself when necessary.  I am well now. What do you see amiss in me?

8760-8760	No, no!

2-2	Well,

8762-8762	if you won't talk, you may be still; I'll let you alone now, and return to my book.

8763-8763	Marmion.

8766-8766	Have you heard from Diana and Mary lately?

8767-8767	Not since the letter I showed you a week ago.

8768-8769	There has not been any change made about your own arrangements?  You will not be summoned to leave England sooner than you expected?

8770-8770	I fear not, indeed: such chance is too good to befall me.

8773-8773	Mary Garrett's mother is better, and Mary came back to the school this morning, and I shall have four new girls next week from the Foundry Close--they would have come to-day but for the snow.

8774-8774	Indeed!

8775-8776	Mr. Oliver pays for two.

8777-8777	Does he?

8778-8778	He means to give the whole school a treat at Christmas.

8779-8779	I know.

8780-8780	Was it your suggestion?

8781-8781	No.

8782-8782	Whose, then?

8783-8783	His daughter's, I think.

8784-8784	It is like her: she is so good-natured.

8785-8785	Yes.

2-2	Leave your book a moment, and come a little nearer the fire,

2-2	Half-an-hour ago,

8790-8792	I spoke of my impatience to hear the sequel of a tale: on reflection, I find the matter will be better managed by my assuming the narrator's part, and converting you into a listener. Before commencing, it is but fair to warn you that the story will sound somewhat hackneyed in your ears; but stale details often regain a degree of freshness when they pass through new lips.  For the rest, whether trite or novel, it is short.

8793-8805	Twenty years ago, a poor curate--never mind his name at this moment--fell in love with a rich man's daughter; she fell in love with him, and married him, against the advice of all her friends, who consequently disowned her immediately after the wedding.  Before two years passed, the rash pair were both dead, and laid quietly side by side under one slab. (I have seen their grave; it formed part of the pavement of a huge churchyard surrounding the grim, soot-black old cathedral of an overgrown manufacturing town in ---shire.)  They left a daughter, which, at its very birth, Charity received in her lap--cold as that of the snow-drift I almost stuck fast in to-night.  Charity carried the friendless thing to the house of its rich maternal relations; it was reared by an aunt-in- law, called (I come to names now) Mrs. Reed of Gateshead.  You start--did you hear a noise?  I daresay it is only a rat scrambling along the rafters of the adjoining schoolroom: it was a barn before I had it repaired and altered, and barns are generally haunted by rats.--To proceed.  Mrs. Reed kept the orphan ten years: whether it was happy or not with her, I cannot say, never having been told; but at the end of that time she transferred it to a place you know--being no other than Lowood School, where you so long resided yourself.  It seems her career there was very honourable: from a pupil, she became a teacher, like yourself--really it strikes me there are parallel points in her history and yours--she left it to be a governess: there, again, your fates were analogous; she undertook the education of the ward of a certain Mr. Rochester.

8806-8807	Mr. Rivers!

2-2	I can guess your feelings,

8809-8816	but restrain them for a while: I have nearly finished; hear me to the end.  Of Mr. Rochester's character I know nothing, but the one fact that he professed to offer honourable marriage to this young girl, and that at the very altar she discovered he had a wife yet alive, though a lunatic.  What his subsequent conduct and proposals were is a matter of pure conjecture; but when an event transpired which rendered inquiry after the governess necessary, it was discovered she was gone--no one could tell when, where, or how.  She had left Thornfield Hall in the night; every research after her course had been vain: the country had been scoured far and wide; no vestige of information could be gathered respecting her.  Yet that she should be found is become a matter of serious urgency: advertisements have been put in all the papers; I myself have received a letter from one Mr. Briggs, a solicitor, communicating the details I have just imparted.  Is it not an odd tale?

2-2	Just tell me this,

8817-8821	and since you know so much, you surely can tell it me--what of Mr. Rochester?  How and where is he?  What is he doing?  Is he well?

8822-8824	I am ignorant of all concerning Mr. Rochester: the letter never mentions him but to narrate the fraudulent and illegal attempt I have adverted to. You should rather ask the name of the governess--the nature of the event which requires her appearance.

8825-8827	Did no one go to Thornfield Hall, then?  Did no one see Mr. Rochester?

8828-8828	I suppose not.

8829-8829	But they wrote to him?

8830-8830	Of course.

8831-8832	And what did he say?  Who has his letters?

8833-8835	Mr. Briggs intimates that the answer to his application was not from Mr. Rochester, but from a lady: it is signed 'Alice Fairfax.'

8839-8839	my dear Edward!

2-2	He must have been a bad man,

2-2	You don't know him--don't pronounce an opinion upon him,

2-2	Very well,

8843-8846	and indeed my head is otherwise occupied than with him: I have my tale to finish.  Since you won't ask the governess's name, I must tell it of my own accord.  Stay!  I have it here--it is always more satisfactory to see important points written down, fairly committed to black and white.

8848-8848	JANE EYRE

2-2	Briggs wrote to me of a Jane Eyre:

8849-8851	the advertisements demanded a Jane Eyre: I knew a Jane Elliott.--I confess I had my suspicions, but it was only yesterday afternoon they were at once resolved into certainty.  You own the name and renounce the _alias_?

8852-8855	Yes--yes; but where is Mr. Briggs?  He perhaps knows more of Mr. Rochester than you do.

8856-8861	Briggs is in London.  I should doubt his knowing anything at all about Mr. Rochester; it is not in Mr. Rochester he is interested.  Meantime, you forget essential points in pursuing trifles: you do not inquire why Mr. Briggs sought after you--what he wanted with you.

8862-8862	Well, what did he want?

8863-8864	Merely to tell you that your uncle, Mr. Eyre of Madeira, is dead; that he has left you all his property, and that you are now rich--merely that--nothing more.

8865-8866	I!--rich?

8867-8867	Yes, you, rich--quite an heiress.

2-2	You must prove your identity of course,

8870-8871	a step which will offer no difficulties; you can then enter on immediate possession.  Your fortune is vested in the English funds; Briggs has the will and the necessary documents.

2-2	You unbend your forehead at last,

8883-8884	I thought Medusa had looked at you, and that you were turning to stone.  Perhaps now you will ask how much you are worth?

8885-8885	How much am I worth?

8886-8887	Oh, a trifle!  Nothing of course to speak of--twenty thousand pounds, I think they say--but what is that?

8888-8888	Twenty thousand pounds?

2-2	Well,

8893-8893	if you had committed a murder, and I had told you your crime was discovered, you could scarcely look more aghast.

8894-8894	It is a large sum--don't you think there is a mistake?

8895-8895	No mistake at all.

8896-8896	Perhaps you have read the figures wrong--it may be two thousand!

8897-8897	It is written in letters, not figures,--twenty thousand.

2-2	If it were not such a very wild night,

8901-8904	I would send Hannah down to keep you company: you look too desperately miserable to be left alone.  But Hannah, poor woman! could not stride the drifts so well as I: her legs are not quite so long: so I must e'en leave you to your sorrows. Good-night.

8906-8906	Stop one minute!

8908-8908	Well?

8909-8910	It puzzles me to know why Mr. Briggs wrote to you about me; or how he knew you, or could fancy that you, living in such an out-of-the-way place, had the power to aid in my discovery.

8911-8911	Oh!  I am a clergyman,

8912-8912	and the clergy are often appealed to about odd matters.

8914-8914	No; that does not satisfy me!

2-2	It is a very strange piece of business,

8916-8916	I must know more about it.

8917-8917	Another time.

8918-8919	No; to-night!--to-night!

2-2	You certainly shall not go till you have told me all,

8923-8923	I would rather not just now.

8924-8925	You shall!--you must!

8926-8926	I would rather Diana or Mary informed you.

2-2	But I apprised you that I was a hard man,

8928-8928	difficult to persuade.

8929-8929	And I am a hard woman,--impossible to put off.

2-2	And then,

8931-8931	I am cold: no fervour infects me.

8932-8935	Whereas I am hot, and fire dissolves ice.  The blaze there has thawed all the snow from your cloak; by the same token, it has streamed on to my floor, and made it like a trampled street.  As you hope ever to be forgiven, Mr. Rivers, the high crime and misdemeanour of spoiling a sanded kitchen, tell me what I wish to know.

2-2	Well, then,

8936-8938	I yield; if not to your earnestness, to your perseverance: as stone is worn by continual dropping.  Besides, you must know some day,--as well now as later.  Your name is Jane Eyre?

8939-8939	Of course: that was all settled before.

8940-8942	You are not, perhaps, aware that I am your namesake?--that I was christened St. John Eyre Rivers?

8943-8946	No, indeed!  I remember now seeing the letter E. comprised in your initials written in books you have at different times lent me; but I never asked for what name it stood.  But what then?  Surely--

8951-8958	My mother's name was Eyre; she had two brothers; one a clergyman, who married Miss Jane Reed, of Gateshead; the other, John Eyre, Esq., merchant, late of Funchal, Madeira.  Mr. Briggs, being Mr. Eyre's solicitor, wrote to us last August to inform us of our uncle's death, and to say that he had left his property to his brother the clergyman's orphan daughter, overlooking us, in consequence of a quarrel, never forgiven, between him and my father.  He wrote again a few weeks since, to intimate that the heiress was lost, and asking if we knew anything of her.  A name casually written on a slip of paper has enabled me to find her out.  You know the rest.

2-2	Do let me speak,

8960-8960	let me have one moment to draw breath and reflect.

8962-8962	Your mother was my father's sister?

8963-8963	Yes.

8964-8964	My aunt, consequently?

8966-8967	My uncle John was your uncle John?  You, Diana, and Mary are his sister's children, as I am his brother's child?

8968-8968	Undeniably.

8969-8969	You three, then, are my cousins; half our blood on each side flows from the same source?

8970-8970	We are cousins; yes.

8980-8981	Oh, I am glad!--I am glad!

8985-8985	Did I not say you neglected essential points to pursue trifles?

8987-8987	You were serious when I told you you had got a fortune; and now, for a matter of no moment, you are excited.

8988-8990	What can you mean?  It may be of no moment to you; you have sisters and don't care for a cousin; but I had nobody; and now three relations,--or two, if you don't choose to be counted,--are born into my world full-grown.  I say again, I am glad!

2-2	Write to Diana and Mary to-morrow,

9001-9002	and tell them to come home directly.  Diana said they would both consider themselves rich with a thousand pounds, so with five thousand they will do very well.

2-2	Tell me where I can get you a glass of water,

9004-9004	you must really make an effort to tranquillise your feelings.

9005-9007	Nonsense! and what sort of an effect will the bequest have on you?  Will it keep you in England, induce you to marry Miss Oliver, and settle down like an ordinary mortal?

9008-9009	You wander: your head becomes confused.  I have been too abrupt in communicating the news; it has excited you beyond your strength.

9010-9012	Mr. Rivers! you quite put me out of patience: I am rational enough; it is you who misunderstand, or rather who affect to misunderstand.

9013-9013	Perhaps, if you explained yourself a little more fully, I should comprehend better.

9014-9017	Explain!  What is there to explain?  You cannot fail to see that twenty thousand pounds, the sum in question, divided equally between the nephew and three nieces of our uncle, will give five thousand to each?  What I want is, that you should write to your sisters and tell them of the fortune that has accrued to them.

9018-9018	To you, you mean.

9019-9025	I have intimated my view of the case: I am incapable of taking any other.  I am not brutally selfish, blindly unjust, or fiendishly ungrateful.  Besides, I am resolved I will have a home and connections.  I like Moor House, and I will live at Moor House; I like Diana and Mary, and I will attach myself for life to Diana and Mary.  It would please and benefit me to have five thousand pounds; it would torment and oppress me to have twenty thousand; which, moreover, could never be mine in justice, though it might in law.  I abandon to you, then, what is absolutely superfluous to me.  Let there be no opposition, and no discussion about it; let us agree amongst each other, and decide the point at once.

9026-9026	This is acting on first impulses; you must take days to consider such a matter, ere your word can be regarded as valid.

9027-9028	Oh! if all you doubt is my sincerity, I am easy: you see the justice of the case?

9029-9031	I _do_ see a certain justice; but it is contrary to all custom.  Besides, the entire fortune is your right: my uncle gained it by his own efforts; he was free to leave it to whom he would: he left it to you.  After all, justice permits you to keep it: you may, with a clear conscience, consider it absolutely your own.

2-2	With me,

9032-9033	it is fully as much a matter of feeling as of conscience: I must indulge my feelings; I so seldom have had an opportunity of doing so.  Were you to argue, object, and annoy me for a year, I could not forego the delicious pleasure of which I have caught a glimpse--that of repaying, in part, a mighty obligation, and winning to myself lifelong friends.

2-2	You think so now,

9035-9035	because you do not know what it is to possess, nor consequently to enjoy wealth: you cannot form a notion of the importance twenty thousand pounds would give you; of the place it would enable you to take in society; of the prospects it would open to you: you cannot--

2-2	And you,

9035-9036	cannot at all imagine the craving I have for fraternal and sisterly love.  I never had a home, I never had brothers or sisters; I must and will have them now: you are not reluctant to admit me and own me, are you?

9037-9037	Jane, I will be your brother--my sisters will be your sisters--without stipulating for this sacrifice of your just rights.

9038-9046	Brother?  Yes; at the distance of a thousand leagues!  Sisters?  Yes; slaving amongst strangers!  I, wealthy--gorged with gold I never earned and do not merit!  You, penniless!  Famous equality and fraternisation! Close union!  Intimate attachment!

9047-9047	But, Jane, your aspirations after family ties and domestic happiness may be realised otherwise than by the means you contemplate: you may marry.

9048-9050	Nonsense, again!  Marry!  I don't want to marry, and never shall marry.

9051-9051	That is saying too much: such hazardous affirmations are a proof of the excitement under which you labour.

9052-9055	It is not saying too much: I know what I feel, and how averse are my inclinations to the bare thought of marriage.  No one would take me for love; and I will not be regarded in the light of a mere money speculation.  And I do not want a stranger--unsympathising, alien, different from me; I want my kindred: those with whom I have full fellow- feeling.  Say again you will be my brother: when you uttered the words I was satisfied, happy; repeat them, if you can, repeat them sincerely.

9056-9059	I think I can.  I know I have always loved my own sisters; and I know on what my affection for them is grounded,--respect for their worth and admiration of their talents.  You too have principle and mind: your tastes and habits resemble Diana's and Mary's; your presence is always agreeable to me; in your conversation I have already for some time found a salutary solace.  I feel I can easily and naturally make room in my heart for you, as my third and youngest sister.

9060-9061	Thank you: that contents me for to-night.  Now you had better go; for if you stay longer, you will perhaps irritate me afresh by some mistrustful scruple.

9062-9063	And the school, Miss Eyre?  It must now be shut up, I suppose?

9064-9065	No.  I will retain my post of mistress till you get a substitute.

9081-9081	Do you consider you have got your reward for a season of exertion?

9084-9084	Does not the consciousness of having done some real good in your day and generation give pleasure?

9085-9085	Doubtless.

9086-9087	And you have only toiled a few months!  Would not a life devoted to the task of regenerating your race be well spent?

2-2	Yes,

9088-9089	but I could not go on for ever so: I want to enjoy my own faculties as well as to cultivate those of other people.  I must enjoy them now; don't recall either my mind or body to the school; I am out of it and disposed for full holiday.

9091-9093	What now?  What sudden eagerness is this you evince? What are you going to do?

9094-9095	To be active: as active as I can.  And first I must beg you to set Hannah at liberty, and get somebody else to wait on you.

9096-9096	Do you want her?

9097-9098	Yes, to go with me to Moor House.  Diana and Mary will be at home in a week, and I want to have everything in order against their arrival.

9099-9101	I understand.  I thought you were for flying off on some excursion.  It is better so: Hannah shall go with you.

9102-9102	Tell her to be ready by to-morrow then; and here is the schoolroom key: I will give you the key of my cottage in the morning.

9104-9104	You give it up very gleefully,

9104-9105	I don't quite understand your light-heartedness, because I cannot tell what employment you propose to yourself as a substitute for the one you are relinquishing.  What aim, what purpose, what ambition in life have you now?

9106-9108	My first aim will be to _clean down_ (do you comprehend the full force of the expression?)--to _clean down_ Moor House from chamber to cellar; my next to rub it up with bees-wax, oil, and an indefinite number of cloths, till it glitters again; my third, to arrange every chair, table, bed, carpet, with mathematical precision; afterwards I shall go near to ruin you in coals and peat to keep up good fires in every room; and lastly, the two days preceding that on which your sisters are expected will be devoted by Hannah and me to such a beating of eggs, sorting of currants, grating of spices, compounding of Christmas cakes, chopping up of materials for mince-pies, and solemnising of other culinary rites, as words can convey but an inadequate notion of to the uninitiated like you. My purpose, in short, is to have all things in an absolutely perfect state of readiness for Diana and Mary before next Thursday; and my ambition is to give them a beau-ideal of a welcome when they come.

2-2	It is all very well for the present,

9111-9111	but seriously, I trust that when the first flush of vivacity is over, you will look a little higher than domestic endearments and household joys.

9112-9112	The best things the world has!

9114-9114	No, Jane, no: this world is not the scene of fruition; do not attempt to make it so: nor of rest; do not turn slothful.

9115-9115	I mean, on the contrary, to be busy.

9116-9117	Jane, I excuse you for the present: two months' grace I allow you for the full enjoyment of your new position, and for pleasing yourself with this late-found charm of relationship; but _then_, I hope you will begin to look beyond Moor House and Morton, and sisterly society, and the selfish calm and sensual comfort of civilised affluence.  I hope your energies will then once more trouble you with their strength.

9119-9119	St. John,

9120-9122	I think you are almost wicked to talk so.  I am disposed to be as content as a queen, and you try to stir me up to restlessness!  To what end?

9123-9127	To the end of turning to profit the talents which God has committed to your keeping; and of which He will surely one day demand a strict account.  Jane, I shall watch you closely and anxiously--I warn you of that.  And try to restrain the disproportionate fervour with which you throw yourself into commonplace home pleasures.  Don't cling so tenaciously to ties of the flesh; save your constancy and ardour for an adequate cause; forbear to waste them on trite transient objects.  Do you hear, Jane?

9128-9130	Yes; just as if you were speaking Greek.  I feel I have adequate cause to be happy, and I _will_ be happy.  Goodbye!

9145-9145	If I was at last satisfied with housemaid's work?

9152-9154	Not at all; he had, on the contrary, remarked that I had scrupulously respected every association: he feared, indeed, I must have bestowed more thought on the matter than it was worth.  How many minutes, for instance, had I devoted to studying the arrangement of this very room?--By-the-bye, could I tell him where such a book was?

2-2	This parlour is not his sphere,

9165-9169	the Himalayan ridge or Caffre bush, even the plague-cursed Guinea Coast swamp would suit him better.  Well may he eschew the calm of domestic life; it is not his element: there his faculties stagnate--they cannot develop or appear to advantage.  It is in scenes of strife and danger--where courage is proved, and energy exercised, and fortitude tasked--that he will speak and move, the leader and superior.  A merry child would have the advantage of him on this hearth.  He is right to choose a missionary's career--I see it now.

9170-9171	They are coming! they are coming!

9194-9195	a poor lad was come, at that unlikely time, to fetch Mr. Rivers to see his mother, who was drawing away.

9196-9196	Where does she live, Hannah?

9197-9197	Clear up at Whitcross Brow, almost four miles off, and moor and moss all the way.

9198-9198	Tell him I will go.

9199-9202	I'm sure, sir, you had better not.  It's the worst road to travel after dark that can be: there's no track at all over the bog.  And then it is such a bitter night--the keenest wind you ever felt.  You had better send word, sir, that you will be there in the morning.

9213-9213	If his plans were yet unchanged.

2-2	Unchanged and unchangeable,

9216-9216	And Rosamond Oliver?

2-2	Rosamond Oliver,

9220-9221	is about to be married to Mr. Granby, one of the best connected and most estimable residents in S-, grandson and heir to Sir Frederic Granby: I had the intelligence from her father yesterday.

2-2	The match must have been got up hastily,

9223-9223	they cannot have known each other long.

9224-9225	But two months: they met in October at the county ball at S-.  But where there are no obstacles to a union, as in the present case, where the connection is in every point desirable, delays are unnecessary: they will be married as soon as S--- Place, which Sir Frederic gives up to them, can he refitted for their reception.

9231-9231	You see, Jane, the battle is fought and the victory won.

9232-9233	But are you sure you are not in the position of those conquerors whose triumphs have cost them too dear?  Would not such another ruin you?

9234-9235	I think not; and if I were, it does not much signify; I shall never be called upon to contend for such another.  The event of the conflict is decisive: my way is now clear; I thank God for it!

2-2	Jane is not such a weakling as you would make her,

9244-9245	she can bear a mountain blast, or a shower, or a few flakes of snow, as well as any of us.  Her constitution is both sound and elastic;--better calculated to endure variations of climate than many more robust.

9251-9251	Jane, what are you doing?

9252-9252	Learning German.

9253-9253	I want you to give up German and learn Hindostanee.

9254-9254	You are not in earnest?

9255-9255	In such earnest that I must have it so: and I will tell you why.

9264-9264	I know it.

9266-9266	go,

9268-9268	come,

9270-9270	do this,

9272-9274	St. John! you used to call Jane your third sister, but you don't treat her as such: you should kiss her too.

9313-9313	We will wait a few minutes, Jane, till you are more composed.

9317-9317	Now, Jane, you shall take a walk; and with me.

9318-9318	I will call Diana and Mary.

9319-9320	No; I want only one companion this morning, and that must be you.  Put on your things; go out by the kitchen-door: take the road towards the head of Marsh Glen: I will join you in a moment.

2-2	Let us rest here,

2-2	And I shall see it again,

9332-9332	in dreams when I sleep by the Ganges: and again in a more remote hour--when another slumber overcomes me--on the shore of a darker stream!

9335-9335	Jane, I go in six weeks; I have taken my berth in an East Indiaman which sails on the 20th of June.

2-2	God will protect you; for you have undertaken His work,

2-2	Yes,

9337-9340	there is my glory and joy.  I am the servant of an infallible Master.  I am not going out under human guidance, subject to the defective laws and erring control of my feeble fellow-worms: my king, my lawgiver, my captain, is the All-perfect.  It seems strange to me that all round me do not burn to enlist under the same banner,--to join in the same enterprise.

9341-9341	All have not your powers, and it would be folly for the feeble to wish to march with the strong.

9342-9342	I do not speak to the feeble, or think of them: I address only such as are worthy of the work, and competent to accomplish it.

9343-9343	Those are few in number, and difficult to discover.

9344-9344	You say truly; but when found, it is right to stir them up--to urge and exhort them to the effort--to show them what their gifts are, and why they were given--to speak Heaven's message in their ear,--to offer them, direct from God, a place in the ranks of His chosen.

9345-9345	If they are really qualified for the task, will not their own hearts be the first to inform them of it?

9347-9347	And what does _your_ heart say?

2-2	My heart is mute,--my heart is mute,

2-2	Then I must speak for it,

9352-9352	Jane, come with me to India: come as my helpmeet and fellow-labourer.

9354-9354	Come over and help us!

9356-9357	Oh, St. John!

9358-9358	have some mercy!

9360-9363	God and nature intended you for a missionary's wife.  It is not personal, but mental endowments they have given you: you are formed for labour, not for love.  A missionary's wife you must--shall be.  You shall be mine: I claim you--not for my pleasure, but for my Sovereign's service.

2-2	I am not fit for it: I have no vocation,

2-2	Humility, Jane,

9367-9375	is the groundwork of Christian virtues: you say right that you are not fit for the work.  Who is fit for it?  Or who, that ever was truly called, believed himself worthy of the summons?  I, for instance, am but dust and ashes.  With St. Paul, I acknowledge myself the chiefest of sinners; but I do not suffer this sense of my personal vileness to daunt me.  I know my Leader: that He is just as well as mighty; and while He has chosen a feeble instrument to perform a great task, He will, from the boundless stores of His providence, supply the inadequacy of the means to the end.  Think like me, Jane--trust like me. It is the Rock of Ages I ask you to lean on: do not doubt but it will bear the weight of your human weakness.

9376-9376	I do not understand a missionary life: I have never studied missionary labours.

9377-9378	There I, humble as I am, can give you the aid you want: I can set you your task from hour to hour; stand by you always; help you from moment to moment.  This I could do in the beginning: soon (for I know your powers) you would be as strong and apt as myself, and would not require my help.

9379-9383	But my powers--where are they for this undertaking?  I do not feel them. Nothing speaks or stirs in me while you talk.  I am sensible of no light kindling--no life quickening--no voice counselling or cheering.  Oh, I wish I could make you see how much my mind is at this moment like a rayless dungeon, with one shrinking fear fettered in its depths--the fear of being persuaded by you to attempt what I cannot accomplish!

9384-9392	I have an answer for you--hear it.  I have watched you ever since we first met: I have made you my study for ten months.  I have proved you in that time by sundry tests: and what have I seen and elicited?  In the village school I found you could perform well, punctually, uprightly, labour uncongenial to your habits and inclinations; I saw you could perform it with capacity and tact: you could win while you controlled.  In the calm with which you learnt you had become suddenly rich, I read a mind clear of the vice of Demas:--lucre had no undue power over you.  In the resolute readiness with which you cut your wealth into four shares, keeping but one to yourself, and relinquishing the three others to the claim of abstract justice, I recognised a soul that revelled in the flame and excitement of sacrifice.  In the tractability with which, at my wish, you forsook a study in which you were interested, and adopted another because it interested me; in the untiring assiduity with which you have since persevered in it--in the unflagging energy and unshaken temper with which you have met its difficulties--I acknowledge the complement of the qualities I seek.  Jane, you are docile, diligent, disinterested, faithful, constant, and courageous; very gentle, and very heroic: cease to mistrust yourself--I can trust you unreservedly.  As a conductress of Indian schools, and a helper amongst Indian women, your assistance will be to me invaluable.

2-2	Very willingly,

2-2	I _can_ do what he wants me to do: I am forced to see and acknowledge that,

9400-9422	that is, if life be spared me.  But I feel mine is not the existence to be long protracted under an Indian sun.  What then? He does not care for that: when my time came to die, he would resign me, in all serenity and sanctity, to the God who gave me.  The case is very plain before me.  In leaving England, I should leave a loved but empty land--Mr. Rochester is not there; and if he were, what is, what can that ever be to me?  My business is to live without him now: nothing so absurd, so weak as to drag on from day to day, as if I were waiting some impossible change in circumstances, which might reunite me to him.  Of course (as St. John once said) I must seek another interest in life to replace the one lost: is not the occupation he now offers me truly the most glorious man can adopt or God assign?  Is it not, by its noble cares and sublime results, the one best calculated to fill the void left by uptorn affections and demolished hopes?  I believe I must say, Yes--and yet I shudder.  Alas!  If I join St. John, I abandon half myself: if I go to India, I go to premature death.  And how will the interval between leaving England for India, and India for the grave, be filled?  Oh, I know well!  That, too, is very clear to my vision.  By straining to satisfy St. John till my sinews ache, I _shall_ satisfy him--to the finest central point and farthest outward circle of his expectations.  If I _do_ go with him--if I _do_ make the sacrifice he urges, I will make it absolutely: I will throw all on the altar--heart, vitals, the entire victim.  He will never love me; but he shall approve me; I will show him energies he has not yet seen, resources he has never suspected.  Yes, I can work as hard as he can, and with as little grudging.

9423-9431	Consent, then, to his demand is possible: but for one item--one dreadful item.  It is--that he asks me to be his wife, and has no more of a husband's heart for me than that frowning giant of a rock, down which the stream is foaming in yonder gorge.  He prizes me as a soldier would a good weapon; and that is all.  Unmarried to him, this would never grieve me; but can I let him complete his calculations--coolly put into practice his plans--go through the wedding ceremony?  Can I receive from him the bridal ring, endure all the forms of love (which I doubt not he would scrupulously observe) and know that the spirit was quite absent?  Can I bear the consciousness that every endearment he bestows is a sacrifice made on principle?  No: such a martyrdom would be monstrous.  I will never undergo it.  As his sister, I might accompany him--not as his wife: I will tell him so.

9434-9434	I am ready to go to India, if I may go free.

2-2	Your answer requires a commentary,

9435-9435	it is not clear.

9436-9436	You have hitherto been my adopted brother--I, your adopted sister: let us continue as such: you and I had better not marry.

9438-9442	Adopted fraternity will not do in this case.  If you were my real sister it would be different: I should take you, and seek no wife.  But as it is, either our union must be consecrated and sealed by marriage, or it cannot exist: practical obstacles oppose themselves to any other plan.  Do you not see it, Jane?  Consider a moment--your strong sense will guide you.

9445-9445	St. John,

9446-9446	I regard you as a brother--you, me as a sister: so let us continue.

2-2	We cannot--we cannot,

9447-9448	it would not do.  You have said you will go with me to India: remember--you have said that.

9449-9449	Conditionally.

9450-9457	Well--well.  To the main point--the departure with me from England, the co-operation with me in my future labours--you do not object.  You have already as good as put your hand to the plough: you are too consistent to withdraw it.  You have but one end to keep in view--how the work you have undertaken can best be done.  Simplify your complicated interests, feelings, thoughts, wishes, aims; merge all considerations in one purpose: that of fulfilling with effect--with power--the mission of your great Master.  To do so, you must have a coadjutor: not a brother--that is a loose tie--but a husband.  I, too, do not want a sister: a sister might any day be taken from me.  I want a wife: the sole helpmeet I can influence efficiently in life, and retain absolutely till death.

9459-9460	Seek one elsewhere than in me, St. John: seek one fitted to you.

9461-9462	One fitted to my purpose, you mean--fitted to my vocation.  Again I tell you it is not the insignificant private individual--the mere man, with the man's selfish senses--I wish to mate: it is the missionary.

9463-9464	And I will give the missionary my energies--it is all he wants--but not myself: that would be only adding the husk and shell to the kernel.  For them he has no use: I retain them.

9465-9469	You cannot--you ought not.  Do you think God will be satisfied with half an oblation?  Will He accept a mutilated sacrifice?  It is the cause of God I advocate: it is under His standard I enlist you.  I cannot accept on His behalf a divided allegiance: it must be entire.

9470-9470	Oh!  I will give my heart to God,

9472-9472	_You_ do not want it.

9485-9485	Is she sarcastic, and sarcastic to _me_!

9487-9487	What does this signify?

2-2	Do not let us forget that this is a solemn matter,

9488-9491	one of which we may neither think nor talk lightly without sin.  I trust, Jane, you are in earnest when you say you will serve your heart to God: it is all I want.  Once wrench your heart from man, and fix it on your Maker, the advancement of that Maker's spiritual kingdom on earth will be your chief delight and endeavour; you will be ready to do at once whatever furthers that end.  You will see what impetus would be given to your efforts and mine by our physical and mental union in marriage: the only union that gives a character of permanent conformity to the destinies and designs of human beings; and, passing over all minor caprices--all trivial difficulties and delicacies of feeling--all scruple about the degree, kind, strength or tenderness of mere personal inclination--you will hasten to enter into that union at once.

9492-9492	Shall I?

9500-9501	St. John!

9503-9503	Well?

9505-9505	I repeat I freely consent to go with you as your fellow-missionary, but not as your wife; I cannot marry you and become part of you.

2-2	A part of me you must become,

9506-9508	otherwise the whole bargain is void.  How can I, a man not yet thirty, take out with me to India a girl of nineteen, unless she be married to me?  How can we be for ever together--sometimes in solitudes, sometimes amidst savage tribes--and unwed?

2-2	Very well,

9509-9509	under the circumstances, quite as well as if I were either your real sister, or a man and a clergyman like yourself.

9510-9511	It is known that you are not my sister; I cannot introduce you as such: to attempt it would be to fasten injurious suspicions on us both.  And for the rest, though you have a man's vigorous brain, you have a woman's heart and--it would not do.

2-2	It would do,

9512-9513	perfectly well.  I have a woman's heart, but not where you are concerned; for you I have only a comrade's constancy; a fellow-soldier's frankness, fidelity, fraternity, if you like; a neophyte's respect and submission to his hierophant: nothing more--don't fear.

2-2	It is what I want,

9514-9517	it is just what I want.  And there are obstacles in the way: they must be hewn down.  Jane, you would not repent marrying me--be certain of that; we _must_ be married.  I repeat it: there is no other way; and undoubtedly enough of love would follow upon marriage to render the union right even in your eyes.

2-2	I scorn your idea of love,

9519-9520	I scorn the counterfeit sentiment you offer: yes, St. John, and I scorn you when you offer it.

2-2	I scarcely expected to hear that expression from you,

9523-9523	I think I have done and uttered nothing to deserve scorn.

9525-9530	Forgive me the words, St. John; but it is your own fault that I have been roused to speak so unguardedly.  You have introduced a topic on which our natures are at variance--a topic we should never discuss: the very name of love is an apple of discord between us.  If the reality were required, what should we do?  How should we feel?  My dear cousin, abandon your scheme of marriage--forget it.

2-2	No,

9531-9536	it is a long-cherished scheme, and the only one which can secure my great end: but I shall urge you no further at present. To-morrow, I leave home for Cambridge: I have many friends there to whom I should wish to say farewell.  I shall be absent a fortnight--take that space of time to consider my offer: and do not forget that if you reject it, it is not me you deny, but God.  Through my means, He opens to you a noble career; as my wife only can you enter upon it.  Refuse to be my wife, and you limit yourself for ever to a track of selfish ease and barren obscurity.  Tremble lest in that case you should be numbered with those who have denied the faith, and are worse than infidels!

9538-9538	Looked to river, looked to hill.

9543-9543	I see you and St. John have been quarrelling, Jane,

9544-9545	during your walk on the moor.  But go after him; he is now lingering in the passage expecting you--he will make it up.

9547-9547	Good-night, St. John,

2-2	Good-night, Jane,

2-2	Then shake hands,

9574-9576	St. John, I am unhappy because you are still angry with me.  Let us be friends.

2-2	I hope we are friends,

9578-9580	No, St. John, we are not friends as we were.  You know that.

9581-9583	Are we not?  That is wrong.  For my part, I wish you no ill and all good.

9584-9585	I believe you, St. John; for I am sure you are incapable of wishing any one ill; but, as I am your kinswoman, I should desire somewhat more of affection than that sort of general philanthropy you extend to mere strangers.

2-2	Of course,

9587-9587	Your wish is reasonable, and I am far from regarding you as a stranger.

9593-9595	Must we part in this way, St. John?  And when you go to India, will you leave me so, without a kinder word than you have yet spoken?

9597-9599	When I go to India, Jane, will I leave you!  What! do you not go to India?

9600-9600	You said I could not unless I married you.

9601-9602	And you will not marry me!  You adhere to that resolution?

9606-9609	No.  St. John, I will not marry you.  I adhere to my resolution.

9611-9611	Once more, why this refusal?

2-2	Formerly,

9613-9615	because you did not love me; now, I reply, because you almost hate me.  If I were to marry you, you would kill me. You are killing me now.

9617-9619	_I should kill you_--_I am killing you_?  Your words are such as ought not to be used: violent, unfeminine, and untrue.  They betray an unfortunate state of mind: they merit severe reproof: they would seem inexcusable, but that it is the duty of man to forgive his fellow even until seventy-and-seven times.

2-2	Now you will indeed hate me,

9623-9623	It is useless to attempt to conciliate you: I see I have made an eternal enemy of you.

2-2	You utterly misinterpret my words,

9628-9628	I have no intention to grieve or pain you--indeed, I have not.

9630-9630	And now you recall your promise, and will not go to India at all, I presume?

2-2	Yes, I will, as your assistant,

9636-9638	I before proved to you the absurdity of a single woman of your age proposing to accompany abroad a single man of mine.  I proved it to you in such terms as, I should have thought, would have prevented your ever again alluding to the plan.  That you have done so, I regret--for your sake.

9641-9645	Keep to common sense, St. John: you are verging on nonsense.  You pretend to be shocked by what I have said.  You are not really shocked: for, with your superior mind, you cannot be either so dull or so conceited as to misunderstand my meaning.  I say again, I will be your curate, if you like, but never your wife.

9647-9649	A female curate, who is not my wife, would never suit me.  With me, then, it seems, you cannot go: but if you are sincere in your offer, I will, while in town, speak to a married missionary, whose wife needs a coadjutor.  Your own fortune will make you independent of the Society's aid; and thus you may still be spared the dishonour of breaking your promise and deserting the band you engaged to join.

9651-9653	There is no dishonour, no breach of promise, no desertion in the case.  I am not under the slightest obligation to go to India, especially with strangers.  With you I would have ventured much, because I admire, confide in, and, as a sister, I love you; but I am convinced that, go when and with whom I would, I should not live long in that climate.

9654-9654	Ah! you are afraid of yourself,

9656-9658	I am.  God did not give me my life to throw away; and to do as you wish me would, I begin to think, be almost equivalent to committing suicide. Moreover, before I definitively resolve on quitting England, I will know for certain whether I cannot be of greater use by remaining in it than by leaving it.

9659-9659	What do you mean?

9660-9660	It would be fruitless to attempt to explain; but there is a point on which I have long endured painful doubt, and I can go nowhere till by some means that doubt is removed.

9661-9665	I know where your heart turns and to what it clings.  The interest you cherish is lawless and unconsecrated.  Long since you ought to have crushed it: now you should blush to allude to it.  You think of Mr. Rochester?

9668-9669	Are you going to seek Mr. Rochester?

9670-9670	I must find out what is become of him.

2-2	It remains for me, then,

9671-9672	to remember you in my prayers, and to entreat God for you, in all earnestness, that you may not indeed become a castaway.  I had thought I recognised in you one of the chosen. But God sees not as man sees: _His_ will be done--

2-2	Jane,

9677-9682	you are always agitated and pale now.  I am sure there is something the matter.  Tell me what business St. John and you have on hands.  I have watched you this half hour from the window; you must forgive my being such a spy, but for a long time I have fancied I hardly know what.  St. John is a strange being--

9683-9684	That brother of mine cherishes peculiar views of some sort respecting you, I am sure: he has long distinguished you by a notice and interest he never showed to any one else--to what end?  I wish he loved you--does he, Jane?

9685-9685	No, Die, not one whit.

9686-9687	Then why does he follow you so with his eyes, and get you so frequently alone with him, and keep you so continually at his side?  Mary and I had both concluded he wished you to marry him.

9688-9688	He does--he has asked me to be his wife.

9690-9692	That is just what we hoped and thought!  And you will marry him, Jane, won't you?  And then he will stay in England.

9693-9693	Far from that, Diana; his sole idea in proposing to me is to procure a fitting fellow-labourer in his Indian toils.

9694-9695	What!  He wishes you to go to India?

9696-9696	Yes.

9697-9697	Madness!

9699-9700	You would not live three months there, I am certain.  You never shall go: you have not consented, have you, Jane?

2-2	I have refused to marry him--

9701-9701	And have consequently displeased him?

9703-9703	Deeply: he will never forgive me, I fear: yet I offered to accompany him as his sister.

9704-9709	It was frantic folly to do so, Jane.  Think of the task you undertook--one of incessant fatigue, where fatigue kills even the strong, and you are weak.  St. John--you know him--would urge you to impossibilities: with him there would be no permission to rest during the hot hours; and unfortunately, I have noticed, whatever he exacts, you force yourself to perform.  I am astonished you found courage to refuse his hand.  You do not love him then, Jane?

9710-9710	Not as a husband.

9711-9711	Yet he is a handsome fellow.

9712-9713	And I am so plain, you see, Die.  We should never suit.

9714-9717	Plain!  You?  Not at all.  You are much too pretty, as well as too good, to be grilled alive in Calcutta.

2-2	I must indeed,

9719-9720	for when just now I repeated the offer of serving him for a deacon, he expressed himself shocked at my want of decency.  He seemed to think I had committed an impropriety in proposing to accompany him unmarried: as if I had not from the first hoped to find in him a brother, and habitually regarded him as such.

9721-9721	What makes you say he does not love you, Jane?

9722-9726	You should hear himself on the subject.  He has again and again explained that it is not himself, but his office he wishes to mate.  He has told me I am formed for labour--not for love: which is true, no doubt.  But, in my opinion, if I am not formed for love, it follows that I am not formed for marriage.  Would it not be strange, Die, to be chained for life to a man who regarded one but as a useful tool?

9727-9727	Insupportable--unnatural--out of the question!

2-2	And then,

9728-9731	though I have only sisterly affection for him now, yet, if forced to be his wife, I can imagine the possibility of conceiving an inevitable, strange, torturing kind of love for him, because he is so talented; and there is often a certain heroic grandeur in his look, manner, and conversation.  In that case, my lot would become unspeakably wretched.  He would not want me to love him; and if I showed the feeling, he would make me sensible that it was a superfluity, unrequired by him, unbecoming in me.  I know he would.

9732-9732	And yet St. John is a good man,

9734-9737	He is a good and a great man; but he forgets, pitilessly, the feelings and claims of little people, in pursuing his own large views.  It is better, therefore, for the insignificant to keep out of his way, lest, in his progress, he should trample them down.  Here he comes!  I will leave you, Diana.

9747-9747	He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his God, and he shall be my son.  But,

9748-9749	the fearful, the unbelieving, &c., shall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the second death.

9761-9768	Thank you, Jane.  As I said, I shall return from Cambridge in a fortnight: that space, then, is yet left you for reflection.  If I listened to human pride, I should say no more to you of marriage with me; but I listen to my duty, and keep steadily in view my first aim--to do all things to the glory of God.  My Master was long-suffering: so will I be.  I cannot give you up to perdition as a vessel of wrath: repent--resolve, while there is yet time.  Remember, we are bid to work while it is day--warned that 'the night cometh when no man shall work.' Remember the fate of Dives, who had his good things in this life.  God give you strength to choose that better part which shall not be taken from you!

9788-9788	Could you decide now?

2-2	I could decide if I were but certain,

9797-9797	were I but convinced that it is God's will I should marry you, I could vow to marry you here and now--come afterwards what would!

9798-9798	My prayers are heard!

9804-9804	Show me, show me the path!

9814-9815	What have you heard?  What do you see?

9818-9820	Jane!  Jane!  Jane!

9822-9823	O God! what is it?

9825-9825	Where is it?

9829-9829	I am coming!

9831-9832	Wait for me!  Oh, I will come!

9835-9835	Where are you?

9837-9837	Where are you?

9840-9840	Down superstition!

9842-9843	This is not thy deception, nor thy witchcraft: it is the work of nature.  She was roused, and did--no miracle--but her best.

9862-9868	You left me too suddenly last night.  Had you stayed but a little longer, you would have laid your hand on the Christian's cross and the angel's crown.  I shall expect your clear decision when I return this day fortnight.  Meantime, watch and pray that you enter not into temptation: the spirit, I trust, is willing, but the flesh, I see, is weak.  I shall pray for you hourly.--Yours, ST. JOHN.

2-2	My spirit,

9869-9870	is willing to do what is right; and my flesh, I hope, is strong enough to accomplish the will of Heaven, when once that will is distinctly known to me.  At any rate, it shall be strong enough to search--inquire--to grope an outlet from this cloud of doubt, and find the open day of certainty.

2-2	In a few more hours I shall succeed you in that track, cousin,

9876-9877	I too have a coach to meet at Whitcross.  I too have some to see and ask after in England, before I depart for ever.

2-2	Ere many days,

9885-9886	I will know something of him whose voice seemed last night to summon me.  Letters have proved of no avail--personal inquiry shall replace them.

9888-9888	Alone, Jane?

9890-9890	Yes; it was to see or hear news of a friend about whom I had for some time been uneasy.

9908-9908	How far is Thornfield Hall from here?

9910-9910	Just two miles, ma'am, across the fields.

2-2	My journey is closed,

9912-9912	The Rochester Arms.

9914-9915	Your master himself may be beyond the British Channel, for aught you know: and then, if he is at Thornfield Hall, towards which you hasten, who besides him is there?  His lunatic wife: and you have nothing to do with him: you dare not speak to him or seek his presence.  You have lost your labour--you had better go no farther,

9917-9919	Ask information of the people at the inn; they can give you all you seek: they can solve your doubts at once.  Go up to that man, and inquire if Mr. Rochester be at home.

9930-9930	My first view of it shall be in front,

9932-9941	where its bold battlements will strike the eye nobly at once, and where I can single out my master's very window: perhaps he will be standing at it--he rises early: perhaps he is now walking in the orchard, or on the pavement in front.  Could I but see him!--but a moment!  Surely, in that case, I should not be so mad as to run to him?  I cannot tell--I am not certain. And if I did--what then?  God bless him!  What then?  Who would be hurt by my once more tasting the life his glance can give me?  I rave: perhaps at this moment he is watching the sun rise over the Pyrenees, or on the tideless sea of the south.

9949-9949	What affectation of diffidence was this at first?

9950-9950	what stupid regardlessness now?

9982-9982	Is he with Damer de Rochester, sharing the shelter of his narrow marble house?

9990-9990	You know Thornfield Hall, of course?

9992-9992	Yes, ma'am; I lived there once.

9993-9993	Did you?

9995-9995	I was the late Mr. Rochester's butler,

9999-9999	The late!

10001-10001	Is he dead?

10002-10002	I mean the present gentleman, Mr. Edward's father,

10008-10008	the present gentleman.

10012-10013	Is Mr. Rochester living at Thornfield Hall now?

10015-10021	No, ma'am--oh, no!  No one is living there.  I suppose you are a stranger in these parts, or you would have heard what happened last autumn,--Thornfield Hall is quite a ruin: it was burnt down just about harvest-time.  A dreadful calamity! such an immense quantity of valuable property destroyed: hardly any of the furniture could be saved.  The fire broke out at dead of night, and before the engines arrived from Millcote, the building was one mass of flame.  It was a terrible spectacle: I witnessed it myself.

10022-10022	At dead of night!

10025-10025	Was it known how it originated?

10027-10028	They guessed, ma'am: they guessed.  Indeed, I should say it was ascertained beyond a doubt.  You are not perhaps aware,

10029-10029	that there was a lady--a--a lunatic, kept in the house?

10030-10030	I have heard something of it.

10031-10035	She was kept in very close confinement, ma'am: people even for some years was not absolutely certain of her existence.  No one saw her: they only knew by rumour that such a person was at the Hall; and who or what she was it was difficult to conjecture.  They said Mr. Edward had brought her from abroad, and some believed she had been his mistress.  But a queer thing happened a year since--a very queer thing.

10038-10038	And this lady?

2-2	This lady, ma'am,

10039-10042	turned out to be Mr. Rochester's wife! The discovery was brought about in the strangest way.  There was a young lady, a governess at the Hall, that Mr. Rochester fell in--

2-2	But the fire,

10044-10053	I'm coming to that, ma'am--that Mr. Edward fell in love with.  The servants say they never saw anybody so much in love as he was: he was after her continually.  They used to watch him--servants will, you know, ma'am--and he set store on her past everything: for all, nobody but him thought her so very handsome.  She was a little small thing, they say, almost like a child.  I never saw her myself; but I've heard Leah, the house-maid, tell of her.  Leah liked her well enough.  Mr. Rochester was about forty, and this governess not twenty; and you see, when gentlemen of his age fall in love with girls, they are often like as if they were bewitched.  Well, he would marry her.

2-2	You shall tell me this part of the story another time,

10054-10056	but now I have a particular reason for wishing to hear all about the fire.  Was it suspected that this lunatic, Mrs. Rochester, had any hand in it?

10057-10070	You've hit it, ma'am: it's quite certain that it was her, and nobody but her, that set it going.  She had a woman to take care of her called Mrs. Poole--an able woman in her line, and very trustworthy, but for one fault--a fault common to a deal of them nurses and matrons--she _kept a private bottle of gin by her_, and now and then took a drop over-much.  It is excusable, for she had a hard life of it: but still it was dangerous; for when Mrs. Poole was fast asleep after the gin and water, the mad lady, who was as cunning as a witch, would take the keys out of her pocket, let herself out of her chamber, and go roaming about the house, doing any wild mischief that came into her head.  They say she had nearly burnt her husband in his bed once: but I don't know about that.  However, on this night, she set fire first to the hangings of the room next her own, and then she got down to a lower storey, and made her way to the chamber that had been the governess's--(she was like as if she knew somehow how matters had gone on, and had a spite at her)--and she kindled the bed there; but there was nobody sleeping in it, fortunately.  The governess had run away two months before; and for all Mr. Rochester sought her as if she had been the most precious thing he had in the world, he never could hear a word of her; and he grew savage--quite savage on his disappointment: he never was a wild man, but he got dangerous after he lost her.  He would be alone, too.  He sent Mrs. Fairfax, the housekeeper, away to her friends at a distance; but he did it handsomely, for he settled an annuity on her for life: and she deserved it--she was a very good woman.  Miss Adele, a ward he had, was put to school.  He broke off acquaintance with all the gentry, and shut himself up like a hermit at the Hall.

10071-10072	What! did he not leave England?

10073-10077	Leave England?  Bless you, no!  He would not cross the door-stones of the house, except at night, when he walked just like a ghost about the grounds and in the orchard as if he had lost his senses--which it is my opinion he had; for a more spirited, bolder, keener gentleman than he was before that midge of a governess crossed him, you never saw, ma'am.  He was not a man given to wine, or cards, or racing, as some are, and he was not so very handsome; but he had a courage and a will of his own, if ever man had.  I knew him from a boy, you see: and for my part, I have often wished that Miss Eyre had been sunk in the sea before she came to Thornfield Hall.

10078-10079	Then Mr. Rochester was at home when the fire broke out?

10080-10085	Yes, indeed was he; and he went up to the attics when all was burning above and below, and got the servants out of their beds and helped them down himself, and went back to get his mad wife out of her cell.  And then they called out to him that she was on the roof, where she was standing, waving her arms, above the battlements, and shouting out till they could hear her a mile off: I saw her and heard her with my own eyes. She was a big woman, and had long black hair: we could see it streaming against the flames as she stood.  I witnessed, and several more witnessed, Mr. Rochester ascend through the sky-light on to the roof; we heard him call 'Bertha!'  We saw him approach her; and then, ma'am, she yelled and gave a spring, and the next minute she lay smashed on the pavement.

10087-10087	Dead?

10088-10089	Dead!  Ay, dead as the stones on which her brains and blood were scattered.

10090-10090	Good God!

10091-10091	You may well say so, ma'am: it was frightful!

10093-10093	And afterwards?

10095-10095	Well, ma'am, afterwards the house was burnt to the ground: there are only some bits of walls standing now.

10096-10096	Were any other lives lost?

10097-10097	No--perhaps it would have been better if there had.

10098-10098	What do you mean?

10099-10100	Poor Mr. Edward!

10101-10102	I little thought ever to have seen it! Some say it was a just judgment on him for keeping his first marriage secret, and wanting to take another wife while he had one living: but I pity him, for my part.

10103-10103	You said he was alive?

10105-10105	Yes, yes: he is alive; but many think he had better be dead.

10106-10107	Why?  How?

10109-10109	Where is he?

10111-10111	Is he in England?

10112-10112	Ay--ay--he's in England; he can't get out of England, I fancy--he's a fixture now.

2-2	He is stone-blind,

10116-10117	Yes, he is stone-blind, is Mr. Edward.

10121-10127	It was all his own courage, and a body may say, his kindness, in a way, ma'am: he wouldn't leave the house till every one else was out before him.  As he came down the great staircase at last, after Mrs. Rochester had flung herself from the battlements, there was a great crash--all fell.  He was taken out from under the ruins, alive, but sadly hurt: a beam had fallen in such a way as to protect him partly; but one eye was knocked out, and one hand so crushed that Mr. Carter, the surgeon, had to amputate it directly.  The other eye inflamed: he lost the sight of that also.  He is now helpless, indeed--blind and a cripple.

10128-10129	Where is he?  Where does he now live?

10130-10130	At Ferndean, a manor-house on a farm he has, about thirty miles off: quite a desolate spot.

10131-10131	Who is with him?

10132-10133	Old John and his wife: he would have none else.  He is quite broken down, they say.

10134-10134	Have you any sort of conveyance?

10135-10135	We have a chaise, ma'am, a very handsome chaise.

10136-10136	Let it be got ready instantly; and if your post-boy can drive me to Ferndean before dark this day, I'll pay both you and him twice the hire you usually demand.

10158-10158	quite a desolate spot.

10160-10160	Can there be life here?

10183-10183	Will you take my arm, sir?

10184-10184	there is a heavy shower coming on: had you not better go in?

2-2	Let me alone,

10191-10191	Mary,

10191-10191	how are you?

10193-10193	Is it really you, miss, come at this late hour to this lonely place?

2-2	When you go in,

10199-10199	tell your master that a person wishes to speak to him, but do not give my name.

2-2	I don't think he will see you,

10200-10200	he refuses everybody.

10202-10202	You are to send in your name and your business,

10204-10204	Is that what he rang for?

10206-10206	Yes: he always has candles brought in at dark, though he is blind.

10207-10207	Give the tray to me; I will carry it in.

10214-10214	Lie down!

2-2	Give me the water, Mary,

10219-10219	What is the matter?

10221-10221	Down, Pilot!

10224-10224	This is you, Mary, is it not?

2-2	Mary is in the kitchen,

10227-10228	Who is this?  Who is this?

10230-10230	Answer me--speak again!

10232-10232	Will you have a little more water, sir?  I spilt half of what was in the glass,

10234-10236	_Who_ is it?  _What_ is it?  Who speaks?

10237-10237	Pilot knows me, and John and Mary know I am here.  I came only this evening,

10239-10241	Great God!--what delusion has come over me?  What sweet madness has seized me?

10242-10242	No delusion--no madness: your mind, sir, is too strong for delusion, your health too sound for frenzy.

10243-10247	And where is the speaker?  Is it only a voice?  Oh!  I _cannot_ see, but I must feel, or my heart will stop and my brain burst.  Whatever--whoever you are--be perceptible to the touch or I cannot live!

10249-10249	Her very fingers!

10250-10251	her small, slight fingers!  If so there must be more of her.

10253-10254	Is it Jane?  _What_ is it?  This is her shape--this is her size--

2-2	And this her voice,

10256-10258	She is all here: her heart, too.  God bless you, sir!  I am glad to be so near you again.

10259-10259	Jane Eyre!--Jane Eyre,

2-2	My dear master,

10261-10261	I am Jane Eyre: I have found you out--I am come back to you.

10262-10264	In truth?--in the flesh?  My living Jane?

10265-10265	You touch me, sir,--you hold me, and fast enough: I am not cold like a corpse, nor vacant like air, am I?

10266-10268	My living darling!  These are certainly her limbs, and these her features; but I cannot be so blest, after all my misery.  It is a dream; such dreams as I have had at night when I have clasped her once more to my heart, as I do now; and kissed her, as thus--and felt that she loved me, and trusted that she would not leave me.

10269-10269	Which I never will, sir, from this day.

10270-10272	Never will, says the vision?  But I always woke and found it an empty mockery; and I was desolate and abandoned--my life dark, lonely, hopeless--my soul athirst and forbidden to drink--my heart famished and never to be fed.  Gentle, soft dream, nestling in my arms now, you will fly, too, as your sisters have all fled before you: but kiss me before you go--embrace me, Jane.

10273-10273	There, sir--and there!

10276-10277	It is you--is it, Jane?  You are come back to me then?

10278-10278	I am.

10279-10280	And you do not lie dead in some ditch under some stream?  And you are not a pining outcast amongst strangers?

10281-10282	No, sir!  I am an independent woman now.

10283-10284	Independent!  What do you mean, Jane?

10285-10285	My uncle in Madeira is dead, and he left me five thousand pounds.

10286-10287	Ah! this is practical--this is real!

10288-10292	I should never dream that.  Besides, there is that peculiar voice of hers, so animating and piquant, as well as soft: it cheers my withered heart; it puts life into it.--What, Janet!  Are you an independent woman?  A rich woman?

10293-10293	If you won't let me live with you, I can build a house of my own close up to your door, and you may come and sit in my parlour when you want company of an evening.

10294-10294	But as you are rich, Jane, you have now, no doubt, friends who will look after you, and not suffer you to devote yourself to a blind lameter like me?

10295-10295	I told you I am independent, sir, as well as rich: I am my own mistress.

10296-10296	And you will stay with me?

10297-10300	Certainly--unless you object.  I will be your neighbour, your nurse, your housekeeper.  I find you lonely: I will be your companion--to read to you, to walk with you, to sit with you, to wait on you, to be eyes and hands to you.  Cease to look so melancholy, my dear master; you shall not be left desolate, so long as I live.

10307-10311	No--no--Jane; you must not go.  No--I have touched you, heard you, felt the comfort of your presence--the sweetness of your consolation: I cannot give up these joys.  I have little left in myself--I must have you.  The world may laugh--may call me absurd, selfish--but it does not signify.  My very soul demands you: it will be satisfied, or it will take deadly vengeance on its frame.

10312-10312	Well, sir, I will stay with you: I have said so.

10313-10316	Yes--but you understand one thing by staying with me; and I understand another.  You, perhaps, could make up your mind to be about my hand and chair--to wait on me as a kind little nurse (for you have an affectionate heart and a generous spirit, which prompt you to make sacrifices for those you pity), and that ought to suffice for me no doubt.  I suppose I should now entertain none but fatherly feelings for you: do you think so? Come--tell me.

10317-10317	I will think what you like, sir: I am content to be only your nurse, if you think it better.

10318-10318	But you cannot always be my nurse, Janet: you are young--you must marry one day.

10319-10319	I don't care about being married.

10320-10320	You should care, Janet: if I were what I once was, I would try to make you care--but--a sightless block!

2-2	It is time some one undertook to rehumanise you,

10324-10325	for I see you are being metamorphosed into a lion, or something of that sort.  You have a 'faux air' of Nebuchadnezzar in the fields about you, that is certain: your hair reminds me of eagles' feathers; whether your nails are grown like birds' claws or not, I have not yet noticed.

2-2	On this arm, I have neither hand nor nails,

10327-10328	It is a mere stump--a ghastly sight!  Don't you think so, Jane?

10329-10329	It is a pity to see it; and a pity to see your eyes--and the scar of fire on your forehead: and the worst of it is, one is in danger of loving you too well for all this; and making too much of you.

10330-10330	I thought you would be revolted, Jane, when you saw my arm, and my cicatrised visage.

10331-10334	Did you?  Don't tell me so--lest I should say something disparaging to your judgment.  Now, let me leave you an instant, to make a better fire, and have the hearth swept up.  Can you tell when there is a good fire?

10335-10335	Yes; with the right eye I see a glow--a ruddy haze.

10336-10336	And you see the candles?

10337-10337	Very dimly--each is a luminous cloud.

10338-10338	Can you see me?

10339-10339	No, my fairy: but I am only too thankful to hear and feel you.

10340-10340	When do you take supper?

10341-10341	I never take supper.

10342-10343	But you shall have some to-night.  I am hungry: so are you, I daresay, only you forget.

10353-10353	Jane.

10354-10355	You are altogether a human being, Jane?  You are certain of that?

10359-10360	I conscientiously believe so, Mr. Rochester.

10361-10362	Yet how, on this dark and doleful evening, could you so suddenly rise on my lone hearth?  I stretched my hand to take a glass of water from a hireling, and it was given me by you: I asked a question, expecting John's wife to answer me, and your voice spoke at my ear.

10363-10363	Because I had come in, in Mary's stead, with the tray.

10364-10370	And there is enchantment in the very hour I am now spending with you. Who can tell what a dark, dreary, hopeless life I have dragged on for months past?  Doing nothing, expecting nothing; merging night in day; feeling but the sensation of cold when I let the fire go out, of hunger when I forgot to eat: and then a ceaseless sorrow, and, at times, a very delirium of desire to behold my Jane again.  Yes: for her restoration I longed, far more than for that of my lost sight.  How can it be that Jane is with me, and says she loves me?  Will she not depart as suddenly as she came?  To-morrow, I fear I shall find her no more.

10373-10373	Where is the use of doing me good in any way, beneficent spirit, when, at some fatal moment, you will again desert me--passing like a shadow, whither and how to me unknown, and for me remaining afterwards undiscoverable?

10374-10374	Have you a pocket-comb about you, sir?

10375-10375	What for, Jane?

10376-10377	Just to comb out this shaggy black mane.  I find you rather alarming, when I examine you close at hand: you talk of my being a fairy, but I am sure, you are more like a brownie.

10378-10378	Am I hideous, Jane?

10379-10379	Very, sir: you always were, you know.

10380-10381	Humph!  The wickedness has not been taken out of you, wherever you have sojourned.

10382-10382	Yet I have been with good people; far better than you: a hundred times better people; possessed of ideas and views you never entertained in your life: quite more refined and exalted.

10383-10383	Who the deuce have you been with?

10384-10384	If you twist in that way you will make me pull the hair out of your head; and then I think you will cease to entertain doubts of my substantiality.

10385-10385	Who have you been with, Jane?

10386-10387	You shall not get it out of me to-night, sir; you must wait till to-morrow; to leave my tale half told, will, you know, be a sort of security that I shall appear at your breakfast table to finish it.  By the bye, I must mind not to rise on your hearth with only a glass of water then: I must bring an egg at the least, to say nothing of fried ham.

10388-10390	You mocking changeling--fairy-born and human-bred!  You make me feel as I have not felt these twelve months.  If Saul could have had you for his David, the evil spirit would have been exorcised without the aid of the harp.

10391-10393	There, sir, you are redd up and made decent.  Now I'll leave you: I have been travelling these last three days, and I believe I am tired.  Good night.

10394-10394	Just one word, Jane: were there only ladies in the house where you have been?

10396-10396	A good idea!

10398-10398	I see I have the means of fretting him out of his melancholy for some time to come.

10400-10400	Is Miss Eyre here?

10401-10404	Which room did you put her into?  Was it dry?  Is she up?  Go and ask if she wants anything; and when she will come down.

2-2	It is a bright, sunny morning, sir,

10413-10413	The rain is over and gone, and there is a tender shining after it: you shall have a walk soon.

10415-10419	Oh, you are indeed there, my skylark!  Come to me.  You are not gone: not vanished?  I heard one of your kind an hour ago, singing high over the wood: but its song had no music for me, any more than the rising sun had rays.  All the melody on earth is concentrated in my Jane's tongue to my ear (I am glad it is not naturally a silent one): all the sunshine I can feel is in her presence.

10427-10432	Cruel, cruel deserter!  Oh, Jane, what did I feel when I discovered you had fled from Thornfield, and when I could nowhere find you; and, after examining your apartment, ascertained that you had taken no money, nor anything which could serve as an equivalent!  A pearl necklace I had given you lay untouched in its little casket; your trunks were left corded and locked as they had been prepared for the bridal tour.  What could my darling do, I asked, left destitute and penniless?  And what did she do?  Let me hear now.

2-2	Well, whatever my sufferings had been, they were very short,

10444-10445	This St. John, then, is your cousin?

10446-10446	Yes.

10447-10447	You have spoken of him often: do you like him?

10448-10448	He was a very good man, sir; I could not help liking him.

10449-10451	A good man.  Does that mean a respectable well-conducted man of fifty? Or what does it mean?

10452-10452	St John was only twenty-nine, sir.

10453-10455	'_Jeune encore_,' as the French say.  Is he a person of low stature, phlegmatic, and plain.  A person whose goodness consists rather in his guiltlessness of vice, than in his prowess in virtue.

10456-10457	He is untiringly active.  Great and exalted deeds are what he lives to perform.

10458-10460	But his brain?  That is probably rather soft?  He means well: but you shrug your shoulders to hear him talk?

10461-10462	He talks little, sir: what he does say is ever to the point.  His brain is first-rate, I should think not impressible, but vigorous.

10463-10463	Is he an able man, then?

10464-10464	Truly able.

10465-10465	A thoroughly educated man?

10466-10467	St. John is an accomplished and profound scholar.

10468-10469	His manners, I think, you said are not to your taste?--priggish and parsonic?

10470-10470	I never mentioned his manners; but, unless I had a very bad taste, they must suit it; they are polished, calm, and gentlemanlike.

10471-10471	His appearance,--I forget what description you gave of his appearance;--a sort of raw curate, half strangled with his white neckcloth, and stilted up on his thick-soled high-lows, eh?

10472-10474	St. John dresses well.  He is a handsome man: tall, fair, with blue eyes, and a Grecian profile.

10476-10476	Damn him!

10478-10478	Did you like him, Jane?

10479-10480	Yes, Mr. Rochester, I liked him: but you asked me that before.

10484-10484	Perhaps you would rather not sit any longer on my knee, Miss Eyre?

10486-10487	Why not, Mr. Rochester?

10488-10490	The picture you have just drawn is suggestive of a rather too overwhelming contrast.  Your words have delineated very prettily a graceful Apollo: he is present to your imagination,--tall, fair, blue- eyed, and with a Grecian profile.  Your eyes dwell on a Vulcan,--a real blacksmith, brown, broad-shouldered: and blind and lame into the bargain.

10491-10491	I never thought of it, before; but you certainly are rather like Vulcan, sir.

2-2	Well, you can leave me, ma'am: but before you go

10492-10492	you will be pleased just to answer me a question or two.

10494-10495	What questions, Mr. Rochester?

10497-10498	St. John made you schoolmistress of Morton before he knew you were his cousin?

10499-10499	Yes.

10500-10501	You would often see him?  He would visit the school sometimes?

10502-10502	Daily.

10503-10504	He would approve of your plans, Jane?  I know they would be clever, for you are a talented creature!

10505-10505	He approved of them--yes.

10506-10507	He would discover many things in you he could not have expected to find? Some of your accomplishments are not ordinary.

10508-10508	I don't know about that.

10509-10509	You had a little cottage near the school, you say: did he ever come there to see you?

10510-10510	Now and then?

10511-10511	Of an evening?

10512-10512	Once or twice.

10514-10514	How long did you reside with him and his sisters after the cousinship was discovered?

10515-10515	Five months.

10516-10516	Did Rivers spend much time with the ladies of his family?

10517-10517	Yes; the back parlour was both his study and ours: he sat near the window, and we by the table.

10518-10518	Did he study much?

10519-10519	A good deal.

10520-10520	What?

10521-10521	Hindostanee.

10522-10522	And what did you do meantime?

10523-10523	I learnt German, at first.

10524-10524	Did he teach you?

10525-10525	He did not understand German.

10526-10526	Did he teach you nothing?

10527-10527	A little Hindostanee.

10528-10528	Rivers taught you Hindostanee?

10529-10529	Yes, sir.

10530-10530	And his sisters also?

10531-10531	No.

10532-10532	Only you?

10533-10533	Only me.

10534-10534	Did you ask to learn?

10535-10535	No.

10536-10536	He wished to teach you?

10537-10537	Yes.

10539-10540	Why did he wish it?  Of what use could Hindostanee be to you?

10541-10541	He intended me to go with him to India.

10542-10544	Ah! here I reach the root of the matter.  He wanted you to marry him?

10545-10545	He asked me to marry him.

10546-10546	That is a fiction--an impudent invention to vex me.

10547-10547	I beg your pardon, it is the literal truth: he asked me more than once, and was as stiff about urging his point as ever you could be.

10548-10550	Miss Eyre, I repeat it, you can leave me.  How often am I to say the same thing?  Why do you remain pertinaciously perched on my knee, when I have given you notice to quit?

10551-10551	Because I am comfortable there.

10552-10558	No, Jane, you are not comfortable there, because your heart is not with me: it is with this cousin--this St. John.  Oh, till this moment, I thought my little Jane was all mine!  I had a belief she loved me even when she left me: that was an atom of sweet in much bitter.  Long as we have been parted, hot tears as I have wept over our separation, I never thought that while I was mourning her, she was loving another!  But it is useless grieving.  Jane, leave me: go and marry Rivers.

10559-10559	Shake me off, then, sir,--push me away, for I'll not leave you of my own accord.

10560-10562	Jane, I ever like your tone of voice: it still renews hope, it sounds so truthful.  When I hear it, it carries me back a year.  I forget that you have formed a new tie.  But I am not a fool--go--

10563-10563	Where must I go, sir?

10564-10564	Your own way--with the husband you have chosen.

10565-10565	Who is that?

10566-10567	You know--this St. John Rivers.

10568-10576	He is not my husband, nor ever will be.  He does not love me: I do not love him.  He loves (as he _can_ love, and that is not as you love) a beautiful young lady called Rosamond.  He wanted to marry me only because he thought I should make a suitable missionary's wife, which she would not have done.  He is good and great, but severe; and, for me, cold as an iceberg.  He is not like you, sir: I am not happy at his side, nor near him, nor with him.  He has no indulgence for me--no fondness.  He sees nothing attractive in me; not even youth--only a few useful mental points.--Then I must leave you, sir, to go to him?

10579-10581	What, Jane!  Is this true?  Is such really the state of matters between you and Rivers?

10582-10586	Absolutely, sir!  Oh, you need not be jealous!  I wanted to tease you a little to make you less sad: I thought anger would be better than grief. But if you wish me to love you, could you but see how much I _do_ love you, you would be proud and content.  All my heart is yours, sir: it belongs to you; and with you it would remain, were fate to exile the rest of me from your presence for ever.

10588-10589	My seared vision!  My crippled strength!

2-2	I am no better than the old lightning-struck chestnut-tree in Thornfield orchard,

10596-10596	And what right would that ruin have to bid a budding woodbine cover its decay with freshness?

10597-10598	You are no ruin, sir--no lightning-struck tree: you are green and vigorous.  Plants will grow about your roots, whether you ask them or not, because they take delight in your bountiful shadow; and as they grow they will lean towards you, and wind round you, because your strength offers them so safe a prop.

10600-10600	You speak of friends, Jane?

2-2	Yes, of friends,

10604-10606	Ah!  Jane.  But I want a wife.

10607-10607	Do you, sir?

10608-10608	Yes: is it news to you?

10609-10609	Of course: you said nothing about it before.

10610-10610	Is it unwelcome news?

10611-10611	That depends on circumstances, sir--on your choice.

10612-10613	Which you shall make for me, Jane.  I will abide by your decision.

10614-10614	Choose then, sir--_her who loves you best_.

10615-10616	I will at least choose--_her I love best_.  Jane, will you marry me?

10617-10617	Yes, sir.

10618-10618	A poor blind man, whom you will have to lead about by the hand?

10619-10619	Yes, sir.

10620-10620	A crippled man, twenty years older than you, whom you will have to wait on?

10621-10621	Yes, sir.

10622-10622	Truly, Jane?

10623-10623	Most truly, sir.

10624-10626	Oh! my darling!  God bless you and reward you!

10627-10629	Mr. Rochester, if ever I did a good deed in my life--if ever I thought a good thought--if ever I prayed a sincere and blameless prayer--if ever I wished a righteous wish,--I am rewarded now.  To be your wife is, for me, to be as happy as I can be on earth.

10630-10630	Because you delight in sacrifice.

10631-10635	Sacrifice!  What do I sacrifice?  Famine for food, expectation for content.  To be privileged to put my arms round what I value--to press my lips to what I love--to repose on what I trust: is that to make a sacrifice?  If so, then certainly I delight in sacrifice.

10636-10636	And to bear with my infirmities, Jane: to overlook my deficiencies.

10637-10638	Which are none, sir, to me.  I love you better now, when I can really be useful to you, than I did in your state of proud independence, when you disdained every part but that of the giver and protector.

10639-10642	Hitherto I have hated to be helped--to be led: henceforth, I feel I shall hate it no more.  I did not like to put my hand into a hireling's, but it is pleasant to feel it circled by Jane's little fingers.  I preferred utter loneliness to the constant attendance of servants; but Jane's soft ministry will be a perpetual joy.  Jane suits me: do I suit her?

10643-10643	To the finest fibre of my nature, sir.

10644-10644	The case being so, we have nothing in the world to wait for: we must be married instantly.

10646-10646	We must become one flesh without any delay, Jane: there is but the licence to get--then we marry.

10647-10649	Mr. Rochester, I have just discovered the sun is far declined from its meridian, and Pilot is actually gone home to his dinner.  Let me look at your watch.

10650-10650	Fasten it into your girdle, Janet, and keep it henceforward: I have no use for it.

10651-10652	It is nearly four o'clock in the afternoon, sir.  Don't you feel hungry?

10653-10654	The third day from this must be our wedding-day, Jane.  Never mind fine clothes and jewels, now: all that is not worth a fillip.

10655-10656	The sun has dried up all the rain-drops, sir.  The breeze is still: it is quite hot.

10657-10658	Do you know, Jane, I have your little pearl necklace at this moment fastened round my bronze scrag under my cravat?  I have worn it since the day I lost my only treasure, as a memento of her.

10659-10659	We will go home through the wood: that will be the shadiest way.

10661-10671	Jane! you think me, I daresay, an irreligious dog: but my heart swells with gratitude to the beneficent God of this earth just now.  He sees not as man sees, but far clearer: judges not as man judges, but far more wisely.  I did wrong: I would have sullied my innocent flower--breathed guilt on its purity: the Omnipotent snatched it from me.  I, in my stiff- necked rebellion, almost cursed the dispensation: instead of bending to the decree, I defied it.  Divine justice pursued its course; disasters came thick on me: I was forced to pass through the valley of the shadow of death.  _His_ chastisements are mighty; and one smote me which has humbled me for ever.  You know I was proud of my strength: but what is it now, when I must give it over to foreign guidance, as a child does its weakness?  Of late, Jane--only--only of late--I began to see and acknowledge the hand of God in my doom.  I began to experience remorse, repentance; the wish for reconcilement to my Maker.  I began sometimes to pray: very brief prayers they were, but very sincere.

10672-10674	Some days since: nay, I can number them--four; it was last Monday night, a singular mood came over me: one in which grief replaced frenzy--sorrow, sullenness.  I had long had the impression that since I could nowhere find you, you must be dead.  Late that night--perhaps it might be between eleven and twelve o'clock--ere I retired to my dreary rest, I supplicated God, that, if it seemed good to Him, I might soon be taken from this life, and admitted to that world to come, where there was still hope of rejoining Jane.

10675-10681	I was in my own room, and sitting by the window, which was open: it soothed me to feel the balmy night-air; though I could see no stars and only by a vague, luminous haze, knew the presence of a moon.  I longed for thee, Janet!  Oh, I longed for thee both with soul and flesh!  I asked of God, at once in anguish and humility, if I had not been long enough desolate, afflicted, tormented; and might not soon taste bliss and peace once more.  That I merited all I endured, I acknowledged--that I could scarcely endure more, I pleaded; and the alpha and omega of my heart's wishes broke involuntarily from my lips in the words--'Jane! Jane!  Jane!'

10682-10682	Did you speak these words aloud?

10683-10684	I did, Jane.  If any listener had heard me, he would have thought me mad: I pronounced them with such frantic energy.

10685-10685	And it was last Monday night, somewhere near midnight?

10686-10687	Yes; but the time is of no consequence: what followed is the strange point.  You will think me superstitious,--some superstition I have in my blood, and always had: nevertheless, this is true--true at least it is that I heard what I now relate.

10688-10691	As I exclaimed 'Jane!  Jane!  Jane!' a voice--I cannot tell whence the voice came, but I know whose voice it was--replied, 'I am coming: wait for me;' and a moment after, went whispering on the wind the words--'Where are you?'

10692-10698	I'll tell you, if I can, the idea, the picture these words opened to my mind: yet it is difficult to express what I want to express.  Ferndean is buried, as you see, in a heavy wood, where sound falls dull, and dies unreverberating.  'Where are you?' seemed spoken amongst mountains; for I heard a hill-sent echo repeat the words.  Cooler and fresher at the moment the gale seemed to visit my brow: I could have deemed that in some wild, lone scene, I and Jane were meeting.  In spirit, I believe we must have met.  You no doubt were, at that hour, in unconscious sleep, Jane: perhaps your soul wandered from its cell to comfort mine; for those were your accents--as certain as I live--they were yours!

2-2	You cannot now wonder,

10705-10708	that when you rose upon me so unexpectedly last night, I had difficulty in believing you any other than a mere voice and vision, something that would melt to silence and annihilation, as the midnight whisper and mountain echo had melted before.  Now, I thank God!  I know it to be otherwise.  Yes, I thank God!

10711-10712	I thank my Maker, that, in the midst of judgment, he has remembered mercy.  I humbly entreat my Redeemer to give me strength to lead henceforth a purer life than I have done hitherto!

10718-10719	Mary, I have been married to Mr. Rochester this morning.

10721-10722	Have you, Miss?  Well, for sure!

2-2	I seed you go out with the master, but I didn't know you were gone to church to be wed;

2-2	I telled Mary how it would be,

10725-10725	I knew what Mr. Edward

10726-10728	I knew what Mr. Edward would do; and I was certain he would not wait long neither: and he's done right, for aught I know.  I wish you joy, Miss!

10730-10732	Thank you, John.  Mr. Rochester told me to give you and Mary this.

10735-10735	She'll happen do better for him nor ony o't' grand ladies.

10736-10736	If she ben't one o' th' handsomest, she's noan faal and varry good-natured; and i' his een she's fair beautiful, onybody may see that.

2-2	She had better not wait till then, Jane,

10741-10741	if she does, she will be too late, for our honeymoon will shine our life long: its beams will only fade over your grave or mine.

10774-10774	Jane, have you a glittering ornament round your neck?

10775-10775	Yes.

10776-10776	And have you a pale blue dress on?

10798-10798	Whosoever will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross and follow me.

2-2	My Master,

10808-10810	has forewarned me.  Daily He announces more distinctly,--'Surely I come quickly!' and hourly I more eagerly respond,--'Amen; even so come, Lord Jesus!'
