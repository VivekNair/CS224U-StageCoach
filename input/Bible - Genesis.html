<p> In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.</p>

<p> And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was<br>
           upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon<br>
           the face of the waters.</p>

<p> And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.</p>

<p> And God saw the light, that it was good: and God divided the<br>
           light from the darkness.</p>

<p> And God called the light Day, and the darkness he called<br>
           Night. And the evening and the morning were the first day.</p>

<p> And God said, Let there be a firmament in the midst of the<br>
           waters, and let it divide the waters from the waters.</p>

<p> And God made the firmament, and divided the waters which were<br>
           under the firmament from the waters which were above the<br>
           firmament: and it was so.</p>

<p> And God called the firmament Heaven. And the evening and the<br>
           morning were the second day.</p>

<p> And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered<br>
           together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it<br>
           was so.</p>

<p> And God called the dry land Earth; and the gathering together<br>
           of the waters called he Seas: and God saw that it was good.</p>

<p> And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb<br>
           yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his<br>
           kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so.</p>

<p> And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed<br>
           after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in<br>
           itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.</p>

<p> And the evening and the morning were the third day.</p>

<p> And God said, Let there be lights in the firmament of the<br>
           heaven to divide the day from the night; and let them be for<br>
           signs, and for seasons, and for days, and years:</p>

<p> And let them be for lights in the firmament of the heaven to<br>
           give light upon the earth: and it was so.</p>

<p> And God made two great lights; the greater light to rule the<br>
           day, and the lesser light to rule the night: he made the stars<br>
           also.</p>

<p> And God set them in the firmament of the heaven to give light<br>
           upon the earth,</p>

<p> And to rule over the day and over the night, and to divide the<br>
           light from the darkness: and God saw that it was good.</p>

<p> And the evening and the morning were the fourth day.</p>

<p> And God said, Let the waters bring forth abundantly the moving<br>
           creature that hath life, and fowl that may fly above the earth<br>
           in the open firmament of heaven.</p>

<p> And God created great whales, and every living creature that<br>
           moveth, which the waters brought forth abundantly, after their<br>
           kind, and every winged fowl after his kind: and God saw that<br>
           it was good.</p>

<p> And God blessed them, saying, Be fruitful, and multiply, and<br>
           fill the waters in the seas, and let fowl multiply in the<br>
           earth.</p>

<p> And the evening and the morning were the fifth day.</p>

<p> And God said, Let the earth bring forth the living creature<br>
           after his kind, cattle, and creeping thing, and beast of the<br>
           earth after his kind: and it was so.</p>

<p> And God made the beast of the earth after his kind, and cattle<br>
           after their kind, and every thing that creepeth upon the earth<br>
           after his kind: and God saw that it was good.</p>

<p> And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our<br>
           likeness: and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea,<br>
           and over the fowl of the air, and over the cattle, and over<br>
           all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creepeth<br>
           upon the earth.</p>

<p> So God created man in his own image, in the image of God<br>
           created he him; male and female created he them.</p>

<p> And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and<br>
           multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have<br>
           dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the<br>
           air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.</p>

<p> And God said, Behold, I have given you every herb bearing<br>
           seed, which is upon the face of all the earth, and every tree,<br>
           in the which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it<br>
           shall be for meat.</p>

<p> And to every beast of the earth, and to every fowl of the air,<br>
           and to every thing that creepeth upon the earth, wherein there<br>
           is life, I have given every green herb for meat: and it was<br>
           so.</p>

<p> And God saw every thing that he had made, and, behold, it was<br>
           very good. And the evening and the morning were the sixth day.</p>

<p> Thus the heavens and the earth were finished, and all the host<br>
           of them.</p>

<p> And on the seventh day God ended his work which he had made;<br>
           and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he<br>
           had made.</p>

<p> And God blessed the seventh day, and sanctified it: because<br>
           that in it he had rested from all his work which God created<br>
           and made.</p>

<p> These are the generations of the heavens and of the earth when<br>
           they were created, in the day that the LORD God made the earth<br>
           and the heavens,</p>

<p> And every plant of the field before it was in the earth, and<br>
           every herb of the field before it grew: for the LORD God had<br>
           not caused it to rain upon the earth, and there was not a man<br>
           to till the ground.</p>

<p> But there went up a mist from the earth, and watered the whole<br>
           face of the ground.</p>

<p> And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground, and<br>
           breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became<br>
           a living soul.</p>

<p> And the LORD God planted a garden eastward in Eden; and there<br>
           he put the man whom he had formed.</p>

<p> And out of the ground made the LORD God to grow every tree<br>
           that is pleasant to the sight, and good for food; the tree of<br>
           life also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of<br>
           knowledge of good and evil.</p>

<p> And a river went out of Eden to water the garden; and from<br>
           thence it was parted, and became into four heads.</p>

<p> The name of the first is Pison: that is it which compasseth<br>
           the whole land of Havilah, where there is gold;</p>

<p> And the gold of that land is good: there is bdellium and the<br>
           onyx stone.</p>

<p> And the name of the second river is Gihon: the same is it that<br>
           compasseth the whole land of Ethiopia.</p>

<p> And the name of the third river is Hiddekel: that is it which<br>
           goeth toward the east of Assyria. And the fourth river is<br>
           Euphrates.</p>

<p> And the LORD God took the man, and put him into the garden of<br>
           Eden to dress it and to keep it.</p>

<p> And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, Of every tree of<br>
           the garden thou mayest freely eat:</p>

<p> But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt<br>
           not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou<br>
           shalt surely die.</p>

<p> And the LORD God said, It is not good that the man should be<br>
           alone; I will make him an help meet for him.</p>

<p> And out of the ground the LORD God formed every beast of the<br>
           field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam<br>
           to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called<br>
           every living creature, that was the name thereof.</p>

<p> And Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air,<br>
           and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not<br>
           found an help meet for him.</p>

<p> And the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he<br>
           slept: and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh<br>
           instead thereof;</p>

<p> And the rib, which the LORD God had taken from man, made he a<br>
           woman, and brought her unto the man.</p>

<p> And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my<br>
           flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of<br>
           Man.</p>

<p> Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and<br>
           shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh.</p>

<p> And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not<br>
           ashamed.</p>

<p> Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field<br>
           which the LORD God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea,<br>
           hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?</p>

<p> And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit<br>
           of the trees of the garden:</p>

<p> But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the<br>
           garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall<br>
           ye touch it, lest ye die.</p>

<p> And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die:</p>

<p> For God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your<br>
           eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good<br>
           and evil.</p>

<p> And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and<br>
           that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to<br>
           make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and<br>
           gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat.</p>

<p> And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they<br>
           were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made<br>
           themselves aprons.</p>

<p> And they heard the voice of the LORD God walking in the garden<br>
           in the cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves<br>
           from the presence of the LORD God amongst the trees of the<br>
           garden.</p>

<p> And the LORD God called unto Adam, and said unto him, Where<br>
           art thou?</p>

<p> And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was<br>
           afraid, because I was naked; and I hid myself.</p>

<p> And he said, Who told thee that thou wast naked? Hast thou<br>
           eaten of the tree, whereof I commanded thee that thou<br>
           shouldest not eat?</p>

<p> And the man said, The woman whom thou gavest to be with me,<br>
           she gave me of the tree, and I did eat.</p>

<p> And the LORD God said unto the woman, What is this that thou<br>
           hast done? And the woman said, The serpent beguiled me, and I<br>
           did eat.</p>

<p> And the LORD God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done<br>
           this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast<br>
           of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt<br>
           thou eat all the days of thy life:</p>

<p> And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between<br>
           thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou<br>
           shalt bruise his heel.</p>

<p> Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and<br>
           thy conception; in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children; and<br>
           thy desire shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over<br>
           thee.</p>

<p> And unto Adam he said, Because thou hast hearkened unto the<br>
           voice of thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I<br>
           commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is<br>
           the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt thou eat of it all<br>
           the days of thy life;</p>

<p> Thorns also and thistles shall it bring forth to thee; and<br>
           thou shalt eat the herb of the field;</p>

<p> In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou<br>
           return unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for<br>
           dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.</p>

<p> And Adam called his wife's name Eve; because she was the<br>
           mother of all living.</p>

<p> Unto Adam also and to his wife did the LORD God make coats of<br>
           skins, and clothed them.</p>

<p> And the LORD God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us,<br>
           to know good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand,<br>
           and take also of the tree of life, and eat, and live for ever:</p>

<p> Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden,<br>
           to till the ground from whence he was taken.</p>

<p> So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the<br>
           garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned<br>
           every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.</p>

<p> And Adam knew Eve his wife; and she conceived, and bare Cain,<br>
           and said, I have gotten a man from the LORD.</p>

<p> And she again bare his brother Abel. And Abel was a keeper of<br>
           sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground.</p>

<p> And in process of time it came to pass, that Cain brought of<br>
           the fruit of the ground an offering unto the LORD.</p>

<p> And Abel, he also brought of the firstlings of his flock and<br>
           of the fat thereof. And the LORD had respect unto Abel and to<br>
           his offering:</p>

<p> But unto Cain and to his offering he had not respect. And Cain<br>
           was very wroth, and his countenance fell.</p>

<p> And the LORD said unto Cain, Why art thou wroth? and why is<br>
           thy countenance fallen?</p>

<p> If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou<br>
           doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee shall be<br>
           his desire, and thou shalt rule over him.</p>

<p> And Cain talked with Abel his brother: and it came to pass,<br>
           when they were in the field, that Cain rose up against Abel<br>
           his brother, and slew him.</p>

<p> And the LORD said unto Cain, Where is Abel thy brother? And he<br>
           said, I know not: Am I my brother's keeper?</p>

<p> And he said, What hast thou done? the voice of thy brother's<br>
           blood crieth unto me from the ground.</p>

<p> And now art thou cursed from the earth, which hath opened her<br>
           mouth to receive thy brother's blood from thy hand;</p>

<p> When thou tillest the ground, it shall not henceforth yield<br>
           unto thee her strength; a fugitive and a vagabond shalt thou<br>
           be in the earth.</p>

<p> And Cain said unto the LORD, My punishment is greater than I<br>
           can bear.</p>

<p> Behold, thou hast driven me out this day from the face of the<br>
           earth; and from thy face shall I be hid; and I shall be a<br>
           fugitive and a vagabond in the earth; and it shall come to<br>
           pass, that every one that findeth me shall slay me.</p>

<p> And the LORD said unto him, Therefore whosoever slayeth Cain,<br>
           vengeance shall be taken on him sevenfold. And the LORD set a<br>
           mark upon Cain, lest any finding him should kill him.</p>

<p> And Cain went out from the presence of the LORD, and dwelt in<br>
           the land of Nod, on the east of Eden.</p>

<p> And Cain knew his wife; and she conceived, and bare Enoch: and<br>
           he builded a city, and called the name of the city, after the<br>
           name of his son, Enoch.</p>

<p> And unto Enoch was born Irad: and Irad begat Mehujael: and<br>
           Mehujael begat Methusael: and Methusael begat Lamech.</p>

<p> And Lamech took unto him two wives: the name of the one was<br>
           Adah, and the name of the other Zillah.</p>

<p> And Adah bare Jabal: he was the father of such as dwell in<br>
           tents, and of such as have cattle.</p>

<p> And his brother's name was Jubal: he was the father of all<br>
           such as handle the harp and organ.</p>

<p> And Zillah, she also bare Tubalcain, an instructor of every<br>
           artificer in brass and iron: and the sister of Tubalcain was<br>
           Naamah.</p>

<p> And Lamech said unto his wives, Adah and Zillah, Hear my<br>
           voice; ye wives of Lamech, hearken unto my speech: for I have<br>
           slain a man to my wounding, and a young man to my hurt.</p>

<p> If Cain shall be avenged sevenfold, truly Lamech seventy and<br>
           sevenfold.</p>

<p> And Adam knew his wife again; and she bare a son, and called<br>
           his name Seth: For God, said she, hath appointed me another<br>
           seed instead of Abel, whom Cain slew.</p>

<p> And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called<br>
           his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the<br>
           LORD.</p>

<p> This is the book of the generations of Adam. In the day that<br>
           God created man, in the likeness of God made he him;</p>

<p> Male and female created he them; and blessed them, and called<br>
           their name Adam, in the day when they were created.</p>

<p> And Adam lived an hundred and thirty years, and begat a son in<br>
           his own likeness, and after his image; and called his name<br>
           Seth:</p>

<p> And the days of Adam after he had begotten Seth were eight<br>
           hundred years: and he begat sons and daughters:</p>

<p> And all the days that Adam lived were nine hundred and thirty<br>
           years: and he died.</p>

<p> And Seth lived an hundred and five years, and begat Enos:</p>

<p> And Seth lived after he begat Enos eight hundred and seven<br>
           years, and begat sons and daughters:</p>

<p> And all the days of Seth were nine hundred and twelve years:<br>
           and he died.</p>

<p> And Enos lived ninety years, and begat Cainan:</p>

<p> And Enos lived after he begat Cainan eight hundred and fifteen<br>
           years, and begat sons and daughters:</p>

<p> And all the days of Enos were nine hundred and five years: and<br>
           he died.</p>

<p> And Cainan lived seventy years and begat Mahalaleel:</p>

<p> And Cainan lived after he begat Mahalaleel eight hundred and<br>
           forty years, and begat sons and daughters:</p>

<p> And all the days of Cainan were nine hundred and ten years:<br>
           and he died.</p>

<p> And Mahalaleel lived sixty and five years, and begat Jared:</p>

<p> And Mahalaleel lived after he begat Jared eight hundred and<br>
           thirty years, and begat sons and daughters:</p>

<p> And all the days of Mahalaleel were eight hundred ninety and<br>
           five years: and he died.</p>

<p> And Jared lived an hundred sixty and two years, and he begat<br>
           Enoch:</p>

<p> And Jared lived after he begat Enoch eight hundred years, and<br>
           begat sons and daughters:</p>

<p> And all the days of Jared were nine hundred sixty and two<br>
           years: and he died.</p>

<p> And Enoch lived sixty and five years, and begat Methuselah:</p>

<p> And Enoch walked with God after he begat Methuselah three<br>
           hundred years, and begat sons and daughters:</p>

<p> And all the days of Enoch were three hundred sixty and five<br>
           years:</p>

<p> And Enoch walked with God: and he was not; for God took him.</p>

<p> And Methuselah lived an hundred eighty and seven years, and<br>
           begat Lamech.</p>

<p> And Methuselah lived after he begat Lamech seven hundred<br>
           eighty and two years, and begat sons and daughters:</p>

<p> And all the days of Methuselah were nine hundred sixty and<br>
           nine years: and he died.</p>

<p> And Lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a<br>
           son:</p>

<p> And he called his name Noah, saying, This same shall comfort<br>
           us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the<br>
           ground which the LORD hath cursed.</p>

<p> And Lamech lived after he begat Noah five hundred ninety and<br>
           five years, and begat sons and daughters:</p>

<p> And all the days of Lamech were seven hundred seventy and<br>
           seven years: and he died.</p>

<p> And Noah was five hundred years old: and Noah begat Shem, Ham,<br>
           and Japheth.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of<br>
           the earth, and daughters were born unto them,</p>

<p> That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were<br>
           fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.</p>

<p> And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man,<br>
           for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred<br>
           and twenty years.</p>

<p> There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after<br>
           that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men,<br>
           and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men<br>
           which were of old, men of renown.</p>

<p> And God saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth,<br>
           and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was<br>
           only evil continually.</p>

<p> And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth,<br>
           and it grieved him at his heart.</p>

<p> And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from<br>
           the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping<br>
           thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I<br>
           have made them.</p>

<p> But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.</p>

<p> These are the generations of Noah: Noah was a just man and<br>
           perfect in his generations, and Noah walked with God.</p>

<p> And Noah begat three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth.</p>

<p> The earth also was corrupt before God, and the earth was<br>
           filled with violence.</p>

<p> And God looked upon the earth, and, behold, it was corrupt;<br>
           for all flesh had corrupted his way upon the earth.</p>

<p> And God said unto Noah, The end of all flesh is come before<br>
           me; for the earth is filled with violence through them; and,<br>
           behold, I will destroy them with the earth.</p>

<p> Make thee an ark of gopher wood; rooms shalt thou make in the<br>
           ark, and shalt pitch it within and without with pitch.</p>

<p> And this is the fashion which thou shalt make it of: The<br>
           length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, the breadth<br>
           of it fifty cubits, and the height of it thirty cubits.</p>

<p> A window shalt thou make to the ark, and in a cubit shalt thou<br>
           finish it above; and the door of the ark shalt thou set in the<br>
           side thereof; with lower, second, and third stories shalt thou<br>
           make it.</p>

<p> And, behold, I, even I, do bring a flood of waters upon the<br>
           earth, to destroy all flesh, wherein is the breath of life,<br>
           from under heaven; and every thing that is in the earth shall<br>
           die.</p>

<p> But with thee will I establish my covenant; and thou shalt<br>
           come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy<br>
           sons' wives with thee.</p>

<p> And of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort<br>
           shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee;<br>
           they shall be male and female.</p>

<p> Of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of<br>
           every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every<br>
           sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive.</p>

<p> And take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou<br>
           shalt gather it to thee; and it shall be for food for thee,<br>
           and for them.</p>

<p> Thus did Noah; according to all that God commanded him, so did<br>
           he.</p>

<p> And the LORD said unto Noah, Come thou and all thy house into<br>
           the ark; for thee have I seen righteous before me in this<br>
           generation.</p>

<p> Of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the<br>
           male and his female: and of beasts that are not clean by two,<br>
           the male and his female.</p>

<p> Of fowls also of the air by sevens, the male and the female;<br>
           to keep seed alive upon the face of all the earth.</p>

<p> For yet seven days, and I will cause it to rain upon the earth<br>
           forty days and forty nights; and every living substance that I<br>
           have made will I destroy from off the face of the earth.</p>

<p> And Noah did according unto all that the LORD commanded him.</p>

<p> And Noah was six hundred years old when the flood of waters<br>
           was upon the earth.</p>

<p> And Noah went in, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'<br>
           wives with him, into the ark, because of the waters of the<br>
           flood.</p>

<p> Of clean beasts, and of beasts that are not clean, and of<br>
           fowls, and of every thing that creepeth upon the earth,</p>

<p> There went in two and two unto Noah into the ark, the male and<br>
           the female, as God had commanded Noah.</p>

<p> And it came to pass after seven days, that the waters of the<br>
           flood were upon the earth.</p>

<p> In the six hundredth year of Noah's life, in the second month,<br>
           the seventeenth day of the month, the same day were all the<br>
           fountains of the great deep broken up, and the windows of<br>
           heaven were opened.</p>

<p> And the rain was upon the earth forty days and forty nights.</p>

<p> In the selfsame day entered Noah, and Shem, and Ham, and<br>
           Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah's wife, and the three<br>
           wives of his sons with them, into the ark;</p>

<p> They, and every beast after his kind, and all the cattle after<br>
           their kind, and every creeping thing that creepeth upon the<br>
           earth after his kind, and every fowl after his kind, every<br>
           bird of every sort.</p>

<p> And they went in unto Noah into the ark, two and two of all<br>
           flesh, wherein is the breath of life.</p>

<p> And they that went in, went in male and female of all flesh,<br>
           as God had commanded him: and the LORD shut him in.</p>

<p> And the flood was forty days upon the earth; and the waters<br>
           increased, and bare up the ark, and it was lift up above the<br>
           earth.</p>

<p> And the waters prevailed, and were increased greatly upon the<br>
           earth; and the ark went upon the face of the waters.</p>

<p> And the waters prevailed exceedingly upon the earth; and all<br>
           the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were<br>
           covered.</p>

<p> Fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail; and the<br>
           mountains were covered.</p>

<p> And all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl,<br>
           and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that<br>
           creepeth upon the earth, and every man:</p>

<p> All in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was<br>
           in the dry land, died.</p>

<p> And every living substance was destroyed which was upon the<br>
           face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping<br>
           things, and the fowl of the heaven; and they were destroyed<br>
           from the earth: and Noah only remained alive, and they that<br>
           were with him in the ark.</p>

<p> And the waters prevailed upon the earth an hundred and fifty<br>
           days.</p>

<p> And God remembered Noah, and every living thing, and all the<br>
           cattle that was with him in the ark: and God made a wind to<br>
           pass over the earth, and the waters asswaged;</p>

<p> The fountains also of the deep and the windows of heaven were<br>
           stopped, and the rain from heaven was restrained;</p>

<p> And the waters returned from off the earth continually: and<br>
           after the end of the hundred and fifty days the waters were<br>
           abated.</p>

<p> And the ark rested in the seventh month, on the seventeenth<br>
           day of the month, upon the mountains of Ararat.</p>

<p> And the waters decreased continually until the tenth month: in<br>
           the tenth month, on the first day of the month, were the tops<br>
           of the mountains seen.</p>

<p> And it came to pass at the end of forty days, that Noah opened<br>
           the window of the ark which he had made:</p>

<p> And he sent forth a raven, which went forth to and fro, until<br>
           the waters were dried up from off the earth.</p>

<p> Also he sent forth a dove from him, to see if the waters were<br>
           abated from off the face of the ground;</p>

<p> But the dove found no rest for the sole of her foot, and she<br>
           returned unto him into the ark, for the waters were on the<br>
           face of the whole earth: then he put forth his hand, and took<br>
           her, and pulled her in unto him into the ark.</p>

<p> And he stayed yet other seven days; and again he sent forth<br>
           the dove out of the ark;</p>

<p> And the dove came in to him in the evening; and, lo, in her<br>
           mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off: so Noah knew that the<br>
           waters were abated from off the earth.</p>

<p> And he stayed yet other seven days; and sent forth the dove;<br>
           which returned not again unto him any more.</p>

<p> And it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in<br>
           the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were<br>
           dried up from off the earth: and Noah removed the covering of<br>
           the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was<br>
           dry.</p>

<p> And in the second month, on the seven and twentieth day of the<br>
           month, was the earth dried.</p>

<p> And God spake unto Noah, saying,</p>

<p> Go forth of the ark, thou, and thy wife, and thy sons, and thy<br>
           sons' wives with thee.</p>

<p> Bring forth with thee every living thing that is with thee, of<br>
           all flesh, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of every creeping<br>
           thing that creepeth upon the earth; that they may breed<br>
           abundantly in the earth, and be fruitful, and multiply upon<br>
           the earth.</p>

<p> And Noah went forth, and his sons, and his wife, and his sons'<br>
           wives with him:</p>

<p> Every beast, every creeping thing, and every fowl, and<br>
           whatsoever creepeth upon the earth, after their kinds, went<br>
           forth out of the ark.</p>

<p> And Noah builded an altar unto the LORD; and took of every<br>
           clean beast, and of every clean fowl, and offered burnt<br>
           offerings on the altar.</p>

<p> And the LORD smelled a sweet savour; and the LORD said in his<br>
           heart, I will not again curse the ground any more for man's<br>
           sake; for the imagination of man's heart is evil from his<br>
           youth; neither will I again smite any more every thing living,<br>
           as I have done.</p>

<p> While the earth remaineth, seedtime and harvest, and cold and<br>
           heat, and summer and winter, and day and night shall not<br>
           cease.</p>

<p> And God blessed Noah and his sons, and said unto them, Be<br>
           fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth.</p>

<p> And the fear of you and the dread of you shall be upon every<br>
           beast of the earth, and upon every fowl of the air, upon all<br>
           that moveth upon the earth, and upon all the fishes of the<br>
           sea; into your hand are they delivered.</p>

<p> Every moving thing that liveth shall be meat for you; even as<br>
           the green herb have I given you all things.</p>

<p> But flesh with the life thereof, which is the blood thereof,<br>
           shall ye not eat.</p>

<p> And surely your blood of your lives will I require; at the<br>
           hand of every beast will I require it, and at the hand of man;<br>
           at the hand of every man's brother will I require the life of<br>
           man.</p>

<p> Whoso sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed:<br>
           for in the image of God made he man.</p>

<p> And you, be ye fruitful, and multiply; bring forth abundantly<br>
           in the earth, and multiply therein.</p>

<p> And God spake unto Noah, and to his sons with him, saying,</p>

<p> And I, behold, I establish my covenant with you, and with your<br>
           seed after you;</p>

<p> And with every living creature that is with you, of the fowl,<br>
           of the cattle, and of every beast of the earth with you; from<br>
           all that go out of the ark, to every beast of the earth.</p>

<p> And I will establish my covenant with you, neither shall all<br>
           flesh be cut off any more by the waters of a flood; neither<br>
           shall there any more be a flood to destroy the earth.</p>

<p> And God said, This is the token of the covenant which I make<br>
           between me and you and every living creature that is with you,<br>
           for perpetual generations:</p>

<p> I do set my bow in the cloud, and it shall be for a token of a<br>
           covenant between me and the earth.</p>

<p> And it shall come to pass, when I bring a cloud over the<br>
           earth, that the bow shall be seen in the cloud:</p>

<p> And I will remember my covenant, which is between me and you<br>
           and every living creature of all flesh; and the waters shall<br>
           no more become a flood to destroy all flesh.</p>

<p> And the bow shall be in the cloud; and I will look upon it,<br>
           that I may remember the everlasting covenant between God and<br>
           every living creature of all flesh that is upon the earth.</p>

<p> And God said unto Noah, This is the token of the covenant,<br>
           which I have established between me and all flesh that is upon<br>
           the earth.</p>

<p> And the sons of Noah, that went forth of the ark, were Shem,<br>
           and Ham, and Japheth: and Ham is the father of Canaan.</p>

<p> These are the three sons of Noah: and of them was the whole<br>
           earth overspread.</p>

<p> And Noah began to be an husbandman, and he planted a vineyard:</p>

<p> And he drank of the wine, and was drunken; and he was<br>
           uncovered within his tent.</p>

<p> And Ham, the father of Canaan, saw the nakedness of his<br>
           father, and told his two brethren without.</p>

<p> And Shem and Japheth took a garment, and laid it upon both<br>
           their shoulders, and went backward, and covered the nakedness<br>
           of their father; and their faces were backward, and they saw<br>
           not their father's nakedness.</p>

<p> And Noah awoke from his wine, and knew what his younger son<br>
           had done unto him.</p>

<p> And he said, Cursed be Canaan; a servant of servants shall he<br>
           be unto his brethren.</p>

<p> And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Shem; and Canaan shall<br>
           be his servant.</p>

<p> God shall enlarge Japheth, and he shall dwell in the tents of<br>
           Shem; and Canaan shall be his servant.</p>

<p> And Noah lived after the flood three hundred and fifty years.</p>

<p> And all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years:<br>
           and he died.</p>

<p> Now these are the generations of the sons of Noah, Shem, Ham,<br>
           and Japheth: and unto them were sons born after the flood.</p>

<p> The sons of Japheth; Gomer, and Magog, and Madai, and Javan,<br>
           and Tubal, and Meshech, and Tiras.</p>

<p> And the sons of Gomer; Ashkenaz, and Riphath, and Togarmah.</p>

<p> And the sons of Javan; Elishah, and Tarshish, Kittim, and<br>
           Dodanim.</p>

<p> By these were the isles of the Gentiles divided in their<br>
           lands; every one after his tongue, after their families, in<br>
           their nations.</p>

<p> And the sons of Ham; Cush, and Mizraim, and Phut, and Canaan.</p>

<p> And the sons of Cush; Seba, and Havilah, and Sabtah, and<br>
           Raamah, and Sabtechah: and the sons of Raamah; Sheba, and<br>
           Dedan.</p>

<p> And Cush begat Nimrod: he began to be a mighty one in the<br>
           earth.</p>

<p> He was a mighty hunter before the LORD: wherefore it is said,<br>
           Even as Nimrod the mighty hunter before the LORD.</p>

<p> And the beginning of his kingdom was Babel, and Erech, and<br>
           Accad, and Calneh, in the land of Shinar.</p>

<p> Out of that land went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, and<br>
           the city Rehoboth, and Calah,</p>

<p> And Resen between Nineveh and Calah: the same is a great city.</p>

<p> And Mizraim begat Ludim, and Anamim, and Lehabim, and<br>
           Naphtuhim,</p>

<p> And Pathrusim, and Casluhim, (out of whom came Philistim,) and<br>
           Caphtorim.</p>

<p> And Canaan begat Sidon his first born, and Heth,</p>

<p> And the Jebusite, and the Amorite, and the Girgasite,</p>

<p> And the Hivite, and the Arkite, and the Sinite,</p>

<p> And the Arvadite, and the Zemarite, and the Hamathite: and<br>
           afterward were the families of the Canaanites spread abroad.</p>

<p> And the border of the Canaanites was from Sidon, as thou<br>
           comest to Gerar, unto Gaza; as thou goest, unto Sodom, and<br>
           Gomorrah, and Admah, and Zeboim, even unto Lasha.</p>

<p> These are the sons of Ham, after their families, after their<br>
           tongues, in their countries, and in their nations.</p>

<p> Unto Shem also, the father of all the children of Eber, the<br>
           brother of Japheth the elder, even to him were children born.</p>

<p> The children of Shem; Elam, and Asshur, and Arphaxad, and Lud,<br>
           and Aram.</p>

<p> And the children of Aram; Uz, and Hul, and Gether, and Mash.</p>

<p> And Arphaxad begat Salah; and Salah begat Eber.</p>

<p> And unto Eber were born two sons: the name of one was Peleg;<br>
           for in his days was the earth divided; and his brother's name<br>
           was Joktan.</p>

<p> And Joktan begat Almodad, and Sheleph, and Hazarmaveth, and<br>
           Jerah,</p>

<p> And Hadoram, and Uzal, and Diklah,</p>

<p> And Obal, and Abimael, and Sheba,</p>

<p> And Ophir, and Havilah, and Jobab: all these were the sons of<br>
           Joktan.</p>

<p> And their dwelling was from Mesha, as thou goest unto Sephar a<br>
           mount of the east.</p>

<p> These are the sons of Shem, after their families, after their<br>
           tongues, in their lands, after their nations.</p>

<p> These are the families of the sons of Noah, after their<br>
           generations, in their nations: and by these were the nations<br>
           divided in the earth after the flood.</p>

<p> And the whole earth was of one language, and of one speech.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, as they journeyed from the east, that<br>
           they found a plain in the land of Shinar; and they dwelt<br>
           there.</p>

<p> And they said one to another, Go to, let us make brick, and<br>
           burn them thoroughly. And they had brick for stone, and slime<br>
           had they for morter.</p>

<p> And they said, Go to, let us build us a city and a tower,<br>
           whose top may reach unto heaven; and let us make us a name,<br>
           lest we be scattered abroad upon the face of the whole earth.</p>

<p> And the LORD came down to see the city and the tower, which<br>
           the children of men builded.</p>

<p> And the LORD said, Behold, the people is one, and they have<br>
           all one language; and this they begin to do: and now nothing<br>
           will be restrained from them, which they have imagined to do.</p>

<p> Go to, let us go down, and there confound their language, that<br>
           they may not understand one another's speech.</p>

<p> So the LORD scattered them abroad from thence upon the face of<br>
           all the earth: and they left off to build the city.</p>

<p> Therefore is the name of it called Babel; because the LORD did<br>
           there confound the language of all the earth: and from thence<br>
           did the LORD scatter them abroad upon the face of all the<br>
           earth.</p>

<p> These are the generations of Shem: Shem was an hundred years<br>
           old, and begat Arphaxad two years after the flood:</p>

<p> And Shem lived after he begat Arphaxad five hundred years, and<br>
           begat sons and daughters.</p>

<p> And Arphaxad lived five and thirty years, and begat Salah:</p>

<p> And Arphaxad lived after he begat Salah four hundred and three<br>
           years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>

<p> And Salah lived thirty years, and begat Eber:</p>

<p> And Salah lived after he begat Eber four hundred and three<br>
           years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>

<p> And Eber lived four and thirty years, and begat Peleg:</p>

<p> And Eber lived after he begat Peleg four hundred and thirty<br>
           years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>

<p> And Peleg lived thirty years, and begat Reu:</p>

<p> And Peleg lived after he begat Reu two hundred and nine years,<br>
           and begat sons and daughters.</p>

<p> And Reu lived two and thirty years, and begat Serug:</p>

<p> And Reu lived after he begat Serug two hundred and seven<br>
           years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>

<p> And Serug lived thirty years, and begat Nahor:</p>

<p> And Serug lived after he begat Nahor two hundred years, and<br>
           begat sons and daughters.</p>

<p> And Nahor lived nine and twenty years, and begat Terah:</p>

<p> And Nahor lived after he begat Terah an hundred and nineteen<br>
           years, and begat sons and daughters.</p>

<p> And Terah lived seventy years, and begat Abram, Nahor, and<br>
           Haran.</p>

<p> Now these are the generations of Terah: Terah begat Abram,<br>
           Nahor, and Haran; and Haran begat Lot.</p>

<p> And Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his<br>
           nativity, in Ur of the Chaldees.</p>

<p> And Abram and Nahor took them wives: the name of Abram's wife<br>
           was Sarai; and the name of Nahor's wife, Milcah, the daughter<br>
           of Haran, the father of Milcah, and the father of Iscah.</p>

<p> But Sarai was barren; she had no child.</p>

<p> And Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran his<br>
           son's son, and Sarai his daughter in law, his son Abram's<br>
           wife; and they went forth with them from Ur of the Chaldees,<br>
           to go into the land of Canaan; and they came unto Haran, and<br>
           dwelt there.</p>

<p> And the days of Terah were two hundred and five years: and<br>
           Terah died in Haran.</p>

<p> Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country,<br>
           and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land<br>
           that I will shew thee:</p>

<p> And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee,<br>
           and make thy name great; and thou shalt be a blessing:</p>

<p> And I will bless them that bless thee, and curse him that<br>
           curseth thee: and in thee shall all families of the earth be<br>
           blessed.</p>

<p> So Abram departed, as the LORD had spoken unto him; and Lot<br>
           went with him: and Abram was seventy and five years old when<br>
           he departed out of Haran.</p>

<p> And Abram took Sarai his wife, and Lot his brother's son, and<br>
           all their substance that they had gathered, and the souls that<br>
           they had gotten in Haran; and they went forth to go into the<br>
           land of Canaan; and into the land of Canaan they came.</p>

<p> And Abram passed through the land unto the place of Sichem,<br>
           unto the plain of Moreh. And the Canaanite was then in the<br>
           land.</p>

<p> And the LORD appeared unto Abram, and said, Unto thy seed will<br>
           I give this land: and there builded he an altar unto the LORD,<br>
           who appeared unto him.</p>

<p> And he removed from thence unto a mountain on the east of<br>
           Bethel, and pitched his tent, having Bethel on the west, and<br>
           Hai on the east: and there he builded an altar unto the LORD,<br>
           and called upon the name of the LORD.</p>

<p> And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south.</p>

<p> And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into<br>
           Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the<br>
           land.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, when he was come near to enter into<br>
           Egypt, that he said unto Sarai his wife, Behold now, I know<br>
           that thou art a fair woman to look upon:</p>

<p> Therefore it shall come to pass, when the Egyptians shall see<br>
           thee, that they shall say, This is his wife: and they will<br>
           kill me, but they will save thee alive.</p>

<p> Say, I pray thee, thou art my sister: that it may be well with<br>
           me for thy sake; and my soul shall live because of thee.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, that, when Abram was come into Egypt, the<br>
           Egyptians beheld the woman that she was very fair.</p>

<p> The princes also of Pharaoh saw her, and commended her before<br>
           Pharaoh: and the woman was taken into Pharaoh's house.</p>

<p> And he entreated Abram well for her sake: and he had sheep,<br>
           and oxen, and he asses, and menservants, and maidservants, and<br>
           she asses, and camels.</p>

<p> And the LORD plagued Pharaoh and his house with great plagues<br>
           because of Sarai Abram's wife.</p>

<p> And Pharaoh called Abram and said, What is this that thou hast<br>
           done unto me? why didst thou not tell me that she was thy<br>
           wife?</p>

<p> Why saidst thou, She is my sister? so I might have taken her<br>
           to me to wife: now therefore behold thy wife, take her, and go<br>
           thy way.</p>

<p> And Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him: and they sent<br>
           him away, and his wife, and all that he had.</p>

<p> And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that<br>
           he had, and Lot with him, into the south.</p>

<p> And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.</p>

<p> And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel,<br>
           unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning,<br>
           between Bethel and Hai;</p>

<p> Unto the place of the altar, which he had make there at the<br>
           first: and there Abram called on the name of the LORD.</p>

<p> And Lot also, which went with Abram, had flocks, and herds,<br>
           and tents.</p>

<p> And the land was not able to bear them, that they might dwell<br>
           together: for their substance was great, so that they could<br>
           not dwell together.</p>

<p> And there was a strife between the herdmen of Abram's cattle<br>
           and the herdmen of Lot's cattle: and the Canaanite and the<br>
           Perizzite dwelled then in the land.</p>

<p> And Abram said unto Lot, Let there be no strife, I pray thee,<br>
           between me and thee, and between my herdmen and thy herdmen;<br>
           for we be brethren.</p>

<p> Is not the whole land before thee? separate thyself, I pray<br>
           thee, from me: if thou wilt take the left hand, then I will go<br>
           to the right; or if thou depart to the right hand, then I will<br>
           go to the left.</p>

<p> And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld all the plain of<br>
           Jordan, that it was well watered every where, before the LORD<br>
           destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah, even as the garden of the LORD,<br>
           like the land of Egypt, as thou comest unto Zoar.</p>

<p> Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan; and Lot journeyed<br>
           east: and they separated themselves the one from the other.</p>

<p> Abram dwelled in the land of Canaan, and Lot dwelled in the<br>
           cities of the plain, and pitched his tent toward Sodom.</p>

<p> But the men of Sodom were wicked and sinners before the LORD<br>
           exceedingly.</p>

<p> And the LORD said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated<br>
           from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place<br>
           where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and<br>
           westward:</p>

<p> For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and<br>
           to thy seed for ever.</p>

<p> And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if<br>
           a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed<br>
           also be numbered.</p>

<p> Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the<br>
           breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee.</p>

<p> Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain<br>
           of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto<br>
           the LORD.</p>

<p> And it came to pass in the days of Amraphel king of Shinar,<br>
           Arioch king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer king of Elam, and Tidal<br>
           king of nations;</p>

<p> That these made war with Bera king of Sodom, and with Birsha<br>
           king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, and Shemeber king of<br>
           Zeboiim, and the king of Bela, which is Zoar.</p>

<p> All these were joined together in the vale of Siddim, which is<br>
           the salt sea.</p>

<p> Twelve years they served Chedorlaomer, and in the thirteenth<br>
           year they rebelled.</p>

<p> And in the fourteenth year came Chedorlaomer, and the kings<br>
           that were with him, and smote the Rephaims in Ashteroth<br>
           Karnaim, and the Zuzims in Ham, and the Emins in Shaveh<br>
           Kiriathaim,</p>

<p> And the Horites in their mount Seir, unto Elparan, which is by<br>
           the wilderness.</p>

<p> And they returned, and came to Enmishpat, which is Kadesh, and<br>
           smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the<br>
           Amorites, that dwelt in Hazezontamar.</p>

<p> And there went out the king of Sodom, and the king of<br>
           Gomorrah, and the king of Admah, and the king of Zeboiim, and<br>
           the king of Bela (the same is Zoar;) and they joined battle<br>
           with them in the vale of Siddim;</p>

<p> With Chedorlaomer the king of Elam, and with Tidal king of<br>
           nations, and Amraphel king of Shinar, and Arioch king of<br>
           Ellasar; four kings with five.</p>

<p> And the vale of Siddim was full of slimepits; and the kings of<br>
           Sodom and Gomorrah fled, and fell there; and they that<br>
           remained fled to the mountain.</p>

<p> And they took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah, and all<br>
           their victuals, and went their way.</p>

<p> And they took Lot, Abram's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom,<br>
           and his goods, and departed.</p>

<p> And there came one that had escaped, and told Abram the<br>
           Hebrew; for he dwelt in the plain of Mamre the Amorite,<br>
           brother of Eshcol, and brother of Aner: and these were<br>
           confederate with Abram.</p>

<p> And when Abram heard that his brother was taken captive, he<br>
           armed his trained servants, born in his own house, three<br>
           hundred and eighteen, and pursued them unto Dan.</p>

<p> And he divided himself against them, he and his servants, by<br>
           night, and smote them, and pursued them unto Hobah, which is<br>
           on the left hand of Damascus.</p>

<p> And he brought back all the goods, and also brought again his<br>
           brother Lot, and his goods, and the women also, and the<br>
           people.</p>

<p> And the king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return<br>
           from the slaughter of Chedorlaomer, and of the kings that were<br>
           with him, at the valley of Shaveh, which is the king's dale.</p>

<p> And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine:<br>
           and he was the priest of the most high God.</p>

<p> And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most<br>
           high God, possessor of heaven and earth:</p>

<p> And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine<br>
           enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.</p>

<p> And the king of Sodom said unto Abram, Give me the persons,<br>
           and take the goods to thyself.</p>

<p> And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lift up mine hand<br>
           unto the LORD, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and<br>
           earth,</p>

<p> That I will not take from a thread even to a shoelatchet, and<br>
           that I will not take any thing that is thine, lest thou<br>
           shouldest say, I have made Abram rich:</p>

<p> Save only that which the young men have eaten, and the portion<br>
           of the men which went with me, Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let<br>
           them take their portion.</p>

<p> After these things the word of the LORD came unto Abram in a<br>
           vision, saying, Fear not, Abram: I am thy shield, and thy<br>
           exceeding great reward.</p>

<p> And Abram said, LORD God, what wilt thou give me, seeing I go<br>
           childless, and the steward of my house is this Eliezer of<br>
           Damascus?</p>

<p> And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and,<br>
           lo, one born in my house is mine heir.</p>

<p> And, behold, the word of the LORD came unto him, saying, This<br>
           shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of<br>
           thine own bowels shall be thine heir.</p>

<p> And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward<br>
           heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them:<br>
           and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.</p>

<p> And he believed in the LORD; and he counted it to him for<br>
           righteousness.</p>

<p> And he said unto him, I am the LORD that brought thee out of<br>
           Ur of the Chaldees, to give thee this land to inherit it.</p>

<p> And he said, LORD God, whereby shall I know that I shall<br>
           inherit it?</p>

<p> And he said unto him, Take me an heifer of three years old,<br>
           and a she goat of three years old, and a ram of three years<br>
           old, and a turtledove, and a young pigeon.</p>

<p> And he took unto him all these, and divided them in the midst,<br>
           and laid each piece one against another: but the birds divided<br>
           he not.</p>

<p> And when the fowls came down upon the carcases, Abram drove<br>
           them away.</p>

<p> And when the sun was going down, a deep sleep fell upon Abram;<br>
           and, lo, an horror of great darkness fell upon him.</p>

<p> And he said unto Abram, Know of a surety that thy seed shall<br>
           be a stranger in a land that is not their's, and shall serve<br>
           them; and they shall afflict them four hundred years;</p>

<p> And also that nation, whom they shall serve, will I judge: and<br>
           afterward shall they come out with great substance.</p>

<p> And thou shalt go to thy fathers in peace; thou shalt be<br>
           buried in a good old age.</p>

<p> But in the fourth generation they shall come hither again: for<br>
           the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet full.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, that, when the sun went down, and it was<br>
           dark, behold a smoking furnace, and a burning lamp that passed<br>
           between those pieces.</p>

<p> In the same day the LORD made a covenant with Abram, saying,<br>
           Unto thy seed have I given this land, from the river of Egypt<br>
           unto the great river, the river Euphrates:</p>

<p> The Kenites, and the Kenizzites, and the Kadmonites,</p>

<p> And the Hittites, and the Perizzites, and the Rephaims,</p>

<p> And the Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Girgashites, and<br>
           the Jebusites.</p>

<p> Now Sarai Abram's wife bare him no children: and she had an<br>
           handmaid, an Egyptian, whose name was Hagar.</p>

<p> And Sarai said unto Abram, Behold now, the LORD hath<br>
           restrained me from bearing: I pray thee, go in unto my maid;<br>
           it may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abram<br>
           hearkened to the voice of Sarai.</p>

<p> And Sarai Abram's wife took Hagar her maid the Egyptian, after<br>
           Abram had dwelt ten years in the land of Canaan, and gave her<br>
           to her husband Abram to be his wife.</p>

<p> And he went in unto Hagar, and she conceived: and when she saw<br>
           that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes.</p>

<p> And Sarai said unto Abram, My wrong be upon thee: I have given<br>
           my maid into thy bosom; and when she saw that she had<br>
           conceived, I was despised in her eyes: the LORD judge between<br>
           me and thee.</p>

<p> But Abram said unto Sarai, Behold, thy maid is in thine hand;<br>
           do to her as it pleaseth thee. And when Sarai dealt hardly<br>
           with her, she fled from her face.</p>

<p> And the angel of the LORD found her by a fountain of water in<br>
           the wilderness, by the fountain in the way to Shur.</p>

<p> And he said, Hagar, Sarai's maid, whence camest thou? and<br>
           whither wilt thou go? And she said, I flee from the face of my<br>
           mistress Sarai.</p>

<p> And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Return to thy<br>
           mistress, and submit thyself under her hands.</p>

<p> And the angel of the LORD said unto her, I will multiply thy<br>
           seed exceedingly, that it shall not be numbered for multitude.</p>

<p> And the angel of the LORD said unto her, Behold, thou art with<br>
           child and shalt bear a son, and shalt call his name Ishmael;<br>
           because the LORD hath heard thy affliction.</p>

<p> And he will be a wild man; his hand will be against every man,<br>
           and every man's hand against him; and he shall dwell in the<br>
           presence of all his brethren.</p>

<p> And she called the name of the LORD that spake unto her, Thou<br>
           God seest me: for she said, Have I also here looked after him<br>
           that seeth me?</p>

<p> Wherefore the well was called Beerlahairoi; behold, it is<br>
           between Kadesh and Bered.</p>

<p> And Hagar bare Abram a son: and Abram called his son's name,<br>
           which Hagar bare, Ishmael.</p>

<p> And Abram was fourscore and six years old, when Hagar bare<br>
           Ishmael to Abram.</p>

<p> And when Abram was ninety years old and nine, the LORD<br>
           appeared to Abram, and said unto him, I am the Almighty God;<br>
           walk before me, and be thou perfect.</p>

<p> And I will make my covenant between me and thee, and will<br>
           multiply thee exceedingly.</p>

<p> And Abram fell on his face: and God talked with him, saying,</p>

<p> As for me, behold, my covenant is with thee, and thou shalt be<br>
           a father of many nations.</p>

<p> Neither shall thy name any more be called Abram, but thy name<br>
           shall be Abraham; for a father of many nations have I made<br>
           thee.</p>

<p> And I will make thee exceeding fruitful, and I will make<br>
           nations of thee, and kings shall come out of thee.</p>

<p> And I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy<br>
           seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting<br>
           covenant, to be a God unto thee, and to thy seed after thee.</p>

<p> And I will give unto thee, and to thy seed after thee, the<br>
           land wherein thou art a stranger, all the land of Canaan, for<br>
           an everlasting possession; and I will be their God.</p>

<p> And God said unto Abraham, Thou shalt keep my covenant<br>
           therefore, thou, and thy seed after thee in their generations.</p>

<p> This is my covenant, which ye shall keep, between me and you<br>
           and thy seed after thee; Every man child among you shall be<br>
           circumcised.</p>

<p> And ye shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin; and it<br>
           shall be a token of the covenant betwixt me and you.</p>

<p> And he that is eight days old shall be circumcised among you,<br>
           every man child in your generations, he that is born in the<br>
           house, or bought with money of any stranger, which is not of<br>
           thy seed.</p>

<p> He that is born in thy house, and he that is bought with thy<br>
           money, must needs be circumcised: and my covenant shall be in<br>
           your flesh for an everlasting covenant.</p>

<p> And the uncircumcised man child whose flesh of his foreskin is<br>
           not circumcised, that soul shall be cut off from his people;<br>
           he hath broken my covenant.</p>

<p> And God said unto Abraham, As for Sarai thy wife, thou shalt<br>
           not call her name Sarai, but Sarah shall her name be.</p>

<p> And I will bless her, and give thee a son also of her: yea, I<br>
           will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of<br>
           people shall be of her.</p>

<p> Then Abraham fell upon his face, and laughed, and said in his<br>
           heart, Shall a child be born unto him that is an hundred years<br>
           old? and shall Sarah, that is ninety years old, bear?</p>

<p> And Abraham said unto God, O that Ishmael might live before<br>
           thee!</p>

<p> And God said, Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed; and<br>
           thou shalt call his name Isaac: and I will establish my<br>
           covenant with him for an everlasting covenant, and with his<br>
           seed after him.</p>

<p> And as for Ishmael, I have heard thee: Behold, I have blessed<br>
           him, and will make him fruitful, and will multiply him<br>
           exceedingly; twelve princes shall he beget, and I will make<br>
           him a great nation.</p>

<p> But my covenant will I establish with Isaac, which Sarah shall<br>
           bear unto thee at this set time in the next year.</p>

<p> And he left off talking with him, and God went up from<br>
           Abraham.</p>

<p> And Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all that were born in<br>
           his house, and all that were bought with his money, every male<br>
           among the men of Abraham's house; and circumcised the flesh of<br>
           their foreskin in the selfsame day, as God had said unto him.</p>

<p> And Abraham was ninety years old and nine, when he was<br>
           circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.</p>

<p> And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old, when he was<br>
           circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin.</p>

<p> In the selfsame day was Abraham circumcised, and Ishmael his<br>
           son.</p>

<p> And all the men of his house, born in the house, and bought<br>
           with money of the stranger, were circumcised with him.</p>

<p> And the LORD appeared unto him in the plains of Mamre: and he<br>
           sat in the tent door in the heat of the day;</p>

<p> And he lift up his eyes and looked, and, lo, three men stood<br>
           by him: and when he saw them, he ran to meet them from the<br>
           tent door, and bowed himself toward the ground,</p>

<p> And said, My LORD, if now I have found favour in thy sight,<br>
           pass not away, I pray thee, from thy servant:</p>

<p> Let a little water, I pray you, be fetched, and wash your<br>
           feet, and rest yourselves under the tree:</p>

<p> And I will fetch a morsel of bread, and comfort ye your<br>
           hearts; after that ye shall pass on: for therefore are ye come<br>
           to your servant. And they said, So do, as thou hast said.</p>

<p> And Abraham hastened into the tent unto Sarah, and said, Make<br>
           ready quickly three measures of fine meal, knead it, and make<br>
           cakes upon the hearth.</p>

<p> And Abraham ran unto the herd, and fetcht a calf tender and<br>
           good, and gave it unto a young man; and he hasted to dress it.</p>

<p> And he took butter, and milk, and the calf which he had<br>
           dressed, and set it before them; and he stood by them under<br>
           the tree, and they did eat.</p>

<p> And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said,<br>
           Behold, in the tent.</p>

<p> And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to<br>
           the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son.<br>
           And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him.</p>

<p> Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and<br>
           it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women.</p>

<p> Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am<br>
           waxed old shall I have pleasure, my lord being old also?</p>

<p> And the LORD said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh,<br>
           saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old?</p>

<p> Is any thing too hard for the LORD? At the time appointed I<br>
           will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and<br>
           Sarah shall have a son.</p>

<p> Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid.<br>
           And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.</p>

<p> And the men rose up from thence, and looked toward Sodom: and<br>
           Abraham went with them to bring them on the way.</p>

<p> And the LORD said, Shall I hide from Abraham that thing which<br>
           I do;</p>

<p> Seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty<br>
           nation, and all the nations of the earth shall be blessed in<br>
           him?</p>

<p> For I know him, that he will command his children and his<br>
           household after him, and they shall keep the way of the LORD,<br>
           to do justice and judgment; that the LORD may bring upon<br>
           Abraham that which he hath spoken of him.</p>

<p> And the LORD said, Because the cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is<br>
           great, and because their sin is very grievous;</p>

<p> I will go down now, and see whether they have done altogether<br>
           according to the cry of it, which is come unto me; and if not,<br>
           I will know.</p>

<p> And the men turned their faces from thence, and went toward<br>
           Sodom: but Abraham stood yet before the LORD.</p>

<p> And Abraham drew near, and said, Wilt thou also destroy the<br>
           righteous with the wicked?</p>

<p> Peradventure there be fifty righteous within the city: wilt<br>
           thou also destroy and not spare the place for the fifty<br>
           righteous that are therein?</p>

<p> That be far from thee to do after this manner, to slay the<br>
           righteous with the wicked: and that the righteous should be as<br>
           the wicked, that be far from thee: Shall not the Judge of all<br>
           the earth do right?</p>

<p> And the LORD said, If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within<br>
           the city, then I will spare all the place for their sakes.</p>

<p> And Abraham answered and said, Behold now, I have taken upon<br>
           me to speak unto the LORD, which am but dust and ashes:</p>

<p> Peradventure there shall lack five of the fifty righteous:<br>
           wilt thou destroy all the city for lack of five? And he said,<br>
           If I find there forty and five, I will not destroy it.</p>

<p> And he spake unto him yet again, and said, Peradventure there<br>
           shall be forty found there. And he said, I will not do it for<br>
           forty's sake.</p>

<p> And he said unto him, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will<br>
           speak: Peradventure there shall thirty be found there. And he<br>
           said, I will not do it, if I find thirty there.</p>

<p> And he said, Behold now, I have taken upon me to speak unto<br>
           the LORD: Peradventure there shall be twenty found there. And<br>
           he said, I will not destroy it for twenty's sake.</p>

<p> And he said, Oh let not the LORD be angry, and I will speak<br>
           yet but this once: Peradventure ten shall be found there. And<br>
           he said, I will not destroy it for ten's sake.</p>

<p> And the LORD went his way, as soon as he had left communing<br>
           with Abraham: and Abraham returned unto his place.</p>

<p> And there came two angels to Sodom at even; and Lot sat in the<br>
           gate of Sodom: and Lot seeing them rose up to meet them; and<br>
           he bowed himself with his face toward the ground;</p>

<p> And he said, Behold now, my lords, turn in, I pray you, into<br>
           your servant's house, and tarry all night, and wash your feet,<br>
           and ye shall rise up early, and go on your ways. And they<br>
           said, Nay; but we will abide in the street all night.</p>

<p> And he pressed upon them greatly; and they turned in unto him,<br>
           and entered into his house; and he made them a feast, and did<br>
           bake unleavened bread, and they did eat.</p>

<p> But before they lay down, the men of the city, even the men of<br>
           Sodom, compassed the house round, both old and young, all the<br>
           people from every quarter:</p>

<p> And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men<br>
           which came in to thee this night? bring them out unto us, that<br>
           we may know them.</p>

<p> And Lot went out at the door unto them, and shut the door<br>
           after him,</p>

<p> And said, I pray you, brethren, do not so wickedly.</p>

<p> Behold now, I have two daughters which have not known man; let<br>
           me, I pray you, bring them out unto you, and do ye to them as<br>
           is good in your eyes: only unto these men do nothing; for<br>
           therefore came they under the shadow of my roof.</p>

<p> And they said, Stand back. And they said again, This one<br>
           fellow came in to sojourn, and he will needs be a judge: now<br>
           will we deal worse with thee, than with them. And they pressed<br>
           sore upon the man, even Lot, and came near to break the door.</p>

<p> But the men put forth their hand, and pulled Lot into the<br>
           house to them, and shut to the door.</p>

<p> And they smote the men that were at the door of the house with<br>
           blindness, both small and great: so that they wearied<br>
           themselves to find the door.</p>

<p> And the men said unto Lot, Hast thou here any besides? son in<br>
           law, and thy sons, and thy daughters, and whatsoever thou hast<br>
           in the city, bring them out of this place:</p>

<p> For we will destroy this place, because the cry of them is<br>
           waxen great before the face of the LORD; and the LORD hath<br>
           sent us to destroy it.</p>

<p> And Lot went out, and spake unto his sons in law, which<br>
           married his daughters, and said, Up, get you out of this<br>
           place; for the LORD will destroy this city. But he seemed as<br>
           one that mocked unto his sons in law.</p>

<p> And when the morning arose, then the angels hastened Lot,<br>
           saying, Arise, take thy wife, and thy two daughters, which are<br>
           here; lest thou be consumed in the iniquity of the city.</p>

<p> And while he lingered, the men laid hold upon his hand, and<br>
           upon the hand of his wife, and upon the hand of his two<br>
           daughters; the LORD being merciful unto him: and they brought<br>
           him forth, and set him without the city.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, when they had brought them forth abroad,<br>
           that he said, Escape for thy life; look not behind thee,<br>
           neither stay thou in all the plain; escape to the mountain,<br>
           lest thou be consumed.</p>

<p> And Lot said unto them, Oh, not so, my LORD:</p>

<p> Behold now, thy servant hath found grace in thy sight, and<br>
           thou hast magnified thy mercy, which thou hast shewed unto me<br>
           in saving my life; and I cannot escape to the mountain, lest<br>
           some evil take me, and I die:</p>

<p> Behold now, this city is near to flee unto, and it is a little<br>
           one: Oh, let me escape thither, (is it not a little one?) and<br>
           my soul shall live.</p>

<p> And he said unto him, See, I have accepted thee concerning<br>
           this thing also, that I will not overthrow this city, for the<br>
           which thou hast spoken.</p>

<p> Haste thee, escape thither; for I cannot do anything till thou<br>
           be come thither. Therefore the name of the city was called<br>
           Zoar.</p>

<p> The sun was risen upon the earth when Lot entered into Zoar.</p>

<p> Then the LORD rained upon Sodom and upon Gomorrah brimstone<br>
           and fire from the LORD out of heaven;</p>

<p> And he overthrew those cities, and all the plain, and all the<br>
           inhabitants of the cities, and that which grew upon the<br>
           ground.</p>

<p> But his wife looked back from behind him, and she became a<br>
           pillar of salt.</p>

<p> And Abraham gat up early in the morning to the place where he<br>
           stood before the LORD:</p>

<p> And he looked toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the<br>
           land of the plain, and beheld, and, lo, the smoke of the<br>
           country went up as the smoke of a furnace.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, when God destroyed the cities of the<br>
           plain, that God remembered Abraham, and sent Lot out of the<br>
           midst of the overthrow, when he overthrew the cities in the<br>
           which Lot dwelt.</p>

<p> And Lot went up out of Zoar, and dwelt in the mountain, and<br>
           his two daughters with him; for he feared to dwell in Zoar:<br>
           and he dwelt in a cave, he and his two daughters.</p>

<p> And the firstborn said unto the younger, Our father is old,<br>
           and there is not a man in the earth to come in unto us after<br>
           the manner of all the earth:</p>

<p> Come, let us make our father drink wine, and we will lie with<br>
           him, that we may preserve seed of our father.</p>

<p> And they made their father drink wine that night: and the<br>
           firstborn went in, and lay with her father; and he perceived<br>
           not when she lay down, nor when she arose.</p>

<p> And it came to pass on the morrow, that the firstborn said<br>
           unto the younger, Behold, I lay yesternight with my father:<br>
           let us make him drink wine this night also; and go thou in,<br>
           and lie with him, that we may preserve seed of our father.</p>

<p> And they made their father drink wine that night also: and the<br>
           younger arose, and lay with him; and he perceived not when she<br>
           lay down, nor when she arose.</p>

<p> Thus were both the daughters of Lot with child by their<br>
           father.</p>

<p> And the first born bare a son, and called his name Moab: the<br>
           same is the father of the Moabites unto this day.</p>

<p> And the younger, she also bare a son, and called his name<br>
           Benammi: the same is the father of the children of Ammon unto<br>
           this day.</p>

<p> And Abraham journeyed from thence toward the south country,<br>
           and dwelled between Kadesh and Shur, and sojourned in Gerar.</p>

<p> And Abraham said of Sarah his wife, She is my sister: and<br>
           Abimelech king of Gerar sent, and took Sarah.</p>

<p> But God came to Abimelech in a dream by night, and said to<br>
           him, Behold, thou art but a dead man, for the woman which thou<br>
           hast taken; for she is a man's wife.</p>

<p> But Abimelech had not come near her: and he said, LORD, wilt<br>
           thou slay also a righteous nation?</p>

<p> Said he not unto me, She is my sister? and she, even she<br>
           herself said, He is my brother: in the integrity of my heart<br>
           and innocency of my hands have I done this.</p>

<p> And God said unto him in a dream, Yea, I know that thou didst<br>
           this in the integrity of thy heart; for I also withheld thee<br>
           from sinning against me: therefore suffered I thee not to<br>
           touch her.</p>

<p> Now therefore restore the man his wife; for he is a prophet,<br>
           and he shall pray for thee, and thou shalt live: and if thou<br>
           restore her not, know thou that thou shalt surely die, thou,<br>
           and all that are thine.</p>

<p> Therefore Abimelech rose early in the morning, and called all<br>
           his servants, and told all these things in their ears: and the<br>
           men were sore afraid.</p>

<p> Then Abimelech called Abraham, and said unto him, What hast<br>
           thou done unto us? and what have I offended thee, that thou<br>
           hast brought on me and on my kingdom a great sin? thou hast<br>
           done deeds unto me that ought not to be done.</p>

<p> And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What sawest thou, that thou<br>
           hast done this thing?</p>

<p> And Abraham said, Because I thought, Surely the fear of God is<br>
           not in this place; and they will slay me for my wife's sake.</p>

<p> And yet indeed she is my sister; she is the daughter of my<br>
           father, but not the daughter of my mother; and she became my<br>
           wife.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, when God caused me to wander from my<br>
           father's house, that I said unto her, This is thy kindness<br>
           which thou shalt shew unto me; at every place whither we shall<br>
           come, say of me, He is my brother.</p>

<p> And Abimelech took sheep, and oxen, and menservants, and<br>
           womenservants, and gave them unto Abraham, and restored him<br>
           Sarah his wife.</p>

<p> And Abimelech said, Behold, my land is before thee: dwell<br>
           where it pleaseth thee.</p>

<p> And unto Sarah he said, Behold, I have given thy brother a<br>
           thousand pieces of silver: behold, he is to thee a covering of<br>
           the eyes, unto all that are with thee, and with all other:<br>
           thus she was reproved.</p>

<p> So Abraham prayed unto God: and God healed Abimelech, and his<br>
           wife, and his maidservants; and they bare children.</p>

<p> For the LORD had fast closed up all the wombs of the house of<br>
           Abimelech, because of Sarah Abraham's wife.</p>

<p> And the LORD visited Sarah as he had said, and the LORD did<br>
           unto Sarah as he had spoken.</p>

<p> For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at<br>
           the set time of which God had spoken to him.</p>

<p> And Abraham called the name of his son that was born unto him,<br>
           whom Sarah bare to him, Isaac.</p>

<p> And Abraham circumcised his son Isaac being eight days old, as<br>
           God had commanded him.</p>

<p> And Abraham was an hundred years old, when his son Isaac was<br>
           born unto him.</p>

<p> And Sarah said, God hath made me to laugh, so that all that<br>
           hear will laugh with me.</p>

<p> And she said, Who would have said unto Abraham, that Sarah<br>
           should have given children suck? for I have born him a son in<br>
           his old age.</p>

<p> And the child grew, and was weaned: and Abraham made a great<br>
           feast the same day that Isaac was weaned.</p>

<p> And Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, which she had<br>
           born unto Abraham, mocking.</p>

<p> Wherefore she said unto Abraham, Cast out this bondwoman and<br>
           her son: for the son of this bondwoman shall not be heir with<br>
           my son, even with Isaac.</p>

<p> And the thing was very grievous in Abraham's sight because of<br>
           his son.</p>

<p> And God said unto Abraham, Let it not be grievous in thy sight<br>
           because of the lad, and because of thy bondwoman; in all that<br>
           Sarah hath said unto thee, hearken unto her voice; for in<br>
           Isaac shall thy seed be called.</p>

<p> And also of the son of the bondwoman will I make a nation,<br>
           because he is thy seed.</p>

<p> And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and took bread, and<br>
           a bottle of water, and gave it unto Hagar, putting it on her<br>
           shoulder, and the child, and sent her away: and she departed,<br>
           and wandered in the wilderness of Beersheba.</p>

<p> And the water was spent in the bottle, and she cast the child<br>
           under one of the shrubs.</p>

<p> And she went, and sat her down over against him a good way<br>
           off, as it were a bow shot: for she said, Let me not see the<br>
           death of the child. And she sat over against him, and lift up<br>
           her voice, and wept.</p>

<p> And God heard the voice of the lad; and the angel of God<br>
           called to Hagar out of heaven, and said unto her, What aileth<br>
           thee, Hagar? fear not; for God hath heard the voice of the lad<br>
           where he is.</p>

<p> Arise, lift up the lad, and hold him in thine hand; for I will<br>
           make him a great nation.</p>

<p> And God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water; and she<br>
           went, and filled the bottle with water, and gave the lad<br>
           drink.</p>

<p> And God was with the lad; and he grew, and dwelt in the<br>
           wilderness, and became an archer.</p>

<p> And he dwelt in the wilderness of Paran: and his mother took<br>
           him a wife out of the land of Egypt.</p>

<p> And it came to pass at that time, that Abimelech and Phichol<br>
           the chief captain of his host spake unto Abraham, saying, God<br>
           is with thee in all that thou doest:</p>

<p> Now therefore swear unto me here by God that thou wilt not<br>
           deal falsely with me, nor with my son, nor with my son's son:<br>
           but according to the kindness that I have done unto thee, thou<br>
           shalt do unto me, and to the land wherein thou hast sojourned.</p>

<p> And Abraham said, I will swear.</p>

<p> And Abraham reproved Abimelech because of a well of water,<br>
           which Abimelech's servants had violently taken away.</p>

<p> And Abimelech said, I wot not who hath done this thing;<br>
           neither didst thou tell me, neither yet heard I of it, but to<br>
           day.</p>

<p> And Abraham took sheep and oxen, and gave them unto Abimelech;<br>
           and both of them made a covenant.</p>

<p> And Abraham set seven ewe lambs of the flock by themselves.</p>

<p> And Abimelech said unto Abraham, What mean these seven ewe<br>
           lambs which thou hast set by themselves?</p>

<p> And he said, For these seven ewe lambs shalt thou take of my<br>
           hand, that they may be a witness unto me, that I have digged<br>
           this well.</p>

<p> Wherefore he called that place Beersheba; because there they<br>
           sware both of them.</p>

<p> Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose<br>
           up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they<br>
           returned into the land of the Philistines.</p>

<p> And Abraham planted a grove in Beersheba, and called there on<br>
           the name of the LORD, the everlasting God.</p>

<p> And Abraham sojourned in the Philistines' land many days.</p>

<p> And it came to pass after these things, that God did tempt<br>
           Abraham, and said unto him, Abraham: and he said, Behold, here<br>
           I am.</p>

<p> And he said, Take now thy son, thine only son Isaac, whom thou<br>
           lovest, and get thee into the land of Moriah; and offer him<br>
           there for a burnt offering upon one of the mountains which I<br>
           will tell thee of.</p>

<p> And Abraham rose up early in the morning, and saddled his ass,<br>
           and took two of his young men with him, and Isaac his son, and<br>
           clave the wood for the burnt offering, and rose up, and went<br>
           unto the place of which God had told him.</p>

<p> Then on the third day Abraham lifted up his eyes, and saw the<br>
           place afar off.</p>

<p> And Abraham said unto his young men, Abide ye here with the<br>
           ass; and I and the lad will go yonder and worship, and come<br>
           again to you.</p>

<p> And Abraham took the wood of the burnt offering, and laid it<br>
           upon Isaac his son; and he took the fire in his hand, and a<br>
           knife; and they went both of them together.</p>

<p> And Isaac spake unto Abraham his father, and said, My father:<br>
           and he said, Here am I, my son. And he said, Behold the fire<br>
           and the wood: but where is the lamb for a burnt offering?</p>

<p> And Abraham said, My son, God will provide himself a lamb for<br>
           a burnt offering: so they went both of them together.</p>

<p> And they came to the place which God had told him of; and<br>
           Abraham built an altar there, and laid the wood in order, and<br>
           bound Isaac his son, and laid him on the altar upon the wood.</p>

<p> And Abraham stretched forth his hand, and took the knife to<br>
           slay his son.</p>

<p> And the angel of the LORD called unto him out of heaven, and<br>
           said, Abraham, Abraham: and he said, Here am I.</p>

<p> And he said, Lay not thine hand upon the lad, neither do thou<br>
           any thing unto him: for now I know that thou fearest God,<br>
           seeing thou hast not withheld thy son, thine only son from me.</p>

<p> And Abraham lifted up his eyes, and looked, and behold behind<br>
           him a ram caught in a thicket by his horns: and Abraham went<br>
           and took the ram, and offered him up for a burnt offering in<br>
           the stead of his son.</p>

<p> And Abraham called the name of that place Jehovahjireh: as it<br>
           is said to this day, In the mount of the LORD it shall be<br>
           seen.</p>

<p> And the angel of the LORD called unto Abraham out of heaven<br>
           the second time,</p>

<p> And said, By myself have I sworn, saith the LORD, for because<br>
           thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son,<br>
           thine only son:</p>

<p> That in blessing I will bless thee, and in multiplying I will<br>
           multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand<br>
           which is upon the sea shore; and thy seed shall possess the<br>
           gate of his enemies;</p>

<p> And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;<br>
           because thou hast obeyed my voice.</p>

<p> So Abraham returned unto his young men, and they rose up and<br>
           went together to Beersheba; and Abraham dwelt at Beersheba.</p>

<p> And it came to pass after these things, that it was told<br>
           Abraham, saying, Behold, Milcah, she hath also born children<br>
           unto thy brother Nahor;</p>

<p> Huz his firstborn, and Buz his brother, and Kemuel the father<br>
           of Aram,</p>

<p> And Chesed, and Hazo, and Pildash, and Jidlaph, and Bethuel.</p>

<p> And Bethuel begat Rebekah: these eight Milcah did bear to<br>
           Nahor, Abraham's brother.</p>

<p> And his concubine, whose name was Reumah, she bare also Tebah,<br>
           and Gaham, and Thahash, and Maachah.</p>

<p> And Sarah was an hundred and seven and twenty years old: these<br>
           were the years of the life of Sarah.</p>

<p> And Sarah died in Kirjatharba; the same is Hebron in the land<br>
           of Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep<br>
           for her.</p>

<p> And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the<br>
           sons of Heth, saying,</p>

<p> I am a stranger and a sojourner with you: give me a possession<br>
           of a buryingplace with you, that I may bury my dead out of my<br>
           sight.</p>

<p> And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him,</p>

<p> Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the<br>
           choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall<br>
           withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury<br>
           thy dead.</p>

<p> And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself to the people of the<br>
           land, even to the children of Heth.</p>

<p> And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I<br>
           should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for<br>
           me to Ephron the son of Zohar,</p>

<p> That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath,<br>
           which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is<br>
           worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace<br>
           amongst you.</p>

<p> And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the<br>
           Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of<br>
           Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city,<br>
           saying,</p>

<p> Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave<br>
           that is therein, I give it thee; in the presence of the sons<br>
           of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead.</p>

<p> And Abraham bowed down himself before the people of the land.</p>

<p> And he spake unto Ephron in the audience of the people of the<br>
           land, saying, But if thou wilt give it, I pray thee, hear me:<br>
           I will give thee money for the field; take it of me, and I<br>
           will bury my dead there.</p>

<p> And Ephron answered Abraham, saying unto him,</p>

<p> My lord, hearken unto me: the land is worth four hundred<br>
           shekels of silver; what is that betwixt me and thee? bury<br>
           therefore thy dead.</p>

<p> And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to<br>
           Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the<br>
           sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money<br>
           with the merchant.</p>

<p> And the field of Ephron which was in Machpelah, which was<br>
           before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and<br>
           all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the<br>
           borders round about, were made sure</p>

<p> Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children<br>
           of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city.</p>

<p> And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of<br>
           the field of Machpelah before Mamre: the same is Hebron in the<br>
           land of Canaan.</p>

<p> And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure<br>
           unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of<br>
           Heth.</p>

<p> And Abraham was old, and well stricken in age: and the LORD<br>
           had blessed Abraham in all things.</p>

<p> And Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house, that<br>
           ruled over all that he had, Put, I pray thee, thy hand under<br>
           my thigh:</p>

<p> And I will make thee swear by the LORD, the God of heaven, and<br>
           the God of the earth, that thou shalt not take a wife unto my<br>
           son of the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I dwell:</p>

<p> But thou shalt go unto my country, and to my kindred, and take<br>
           a wife unto my son Isaac.</p>

<p> And the servant said unto him, Peradventure the woman will not<br>
           be willing to follow me unto this land: must I needs bring thy<br>
           son again unto the land from whence thou camest?</p>

<p> And Abraham said unto him, Beware thou that thou bring not my<br>
           son thither again.</p>

<p> The LORD God of heaven, which took me from my father's house,<br>
           and from the land of my kindred, and which spake unto me, and<br>
           that sware unto me, saying, Unto thy seed will I give this<br>
           land; he shall send his angel before thee, and thou shalt take<br>
           a wife unto my son from thence.</p>

<p> And if the woman will not be willing to follow thee, then thou<br>
           shalt be clear from this my oath: only bring not my son<br>
           thither again.</p>

<p> And the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his<br>
           master, and sware to him concerning that matter.</p>

<p> And the servant took ten camels of the camels of his master,<br>
           and departed; for all the goods of his master were in his<br>
           hand: and he arose, and went to Mesopotamia, unto the city of<br>
           Nahor.</p>

<p> And he made his camels to kneel down without the city by a<br>
           well of water at the time of the evening, even the time that<br>
           women go out to draw water.</p>

<p> And he said O LORD God of my master Abraham, I pray thee, send<br>
           me good speed this day, and shew kindness unto my master<br>
           Abraham.</p>

<p> Behold, I stand here by the well of water; and the daughters<br>
           of the men of the city come out to draw water:</p>

<p> And let it come to pass, that the damsel to whom I shall say,<br>
           Let down thy pitcher, I pray thee, that I may drink; and she<br>
           shall say, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink also: let<br>
           the same be she that thou hast appointed for thy servant<br>
           Isaac; and thereby shall I know that thou hast shewed kindness<br>
           unto my master.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, before he had done speaking, that,<br>
           behold, Rebekah came out, who was born to Bethuel, son of<br>
           Milcah, the wife of Nahor, Abraham's brother, with her pitcher<br>
           upon her shoulder.</p>

<p> And the damsel was very fair to look upon, a virgin, neither<br>
           had any man known her: and she went down to the well, and<br>
           filled her pitcher, and came up.</p>

<p> And the servant ran to meet her, and said, Let me, I pray<br>
           thee, drink a little water of thy pitcher.</p>

<p> And she said, Drink, my lord: and she hasted, and let down her<br>
           pitcher upon her hand, and gave him drink.</p>

<p> And when she had done giving him drink, she said, I will draw<br>
           water for thy camels also, until they have done drinking.</p>

<p> And she hasted, and emptied her pitcher into the trough, and<br>
           ran again unto the well to draw water, and drew for all his<br>
           camels.</p>

<p> And the man wondering at her held his peace, to wit whether<br>
           the LORD had made his journey prosperous or not.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, as the camels had done drinking, that the<br>
           man took a golden earring of half a shekel weight, and two<br>
           bracelets for her hands of ten shekels weight of gold;</p>

<p> And said, Whose daughter art thou? tell me, I pray thee: is<br>
           there room in thy father's house for us to lodge in?</p>

<p> And she said unto him, I am the daughter of Bethuel the son of<br>
           Milcah, which she bare unto Nahor.</p>

<p> She said moreover unto him, We have both straw and provender<br>
           enough, and room to lodge in.</p>

<p> And the man bowed down his head, and worshipped the LORD.</p>

<p> And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of my master Abraham, who<br>
           hath not left destitute my master of his mercy and his truth:<br>
           I being in the way, the LORD led me to the house of my<br>
           master's brethren.</p>

<p> And the damsel ran, and told them of her mother's house these<br>
           things.</p>

<p> And Rebekah had a brother, and his name was Laban: and Laban<br>
           ran out unto the man, unto the well.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, when he saw the earring and bracelets<br>
           upon his sister's hands, and when he heard the words of<br>
           Rebekah his sister, saying, Thus spake the man unto me; that<br>
           he came unto the man; and, behold, he stood by the camels at<br>
           the well.</p>

<p> And he said, Come in, thou blessed of the LORD; wherefore<br>
           standest thou without? for I have prepared the house, and room<br>
           for the camels.</p>

<p> And the man came into the house: and he ungirded his camels,<br>
           and gave straw and provender for the camels, and water to wash<br>
           his feet, and the men's feet that were with him.</p>

<p> And there was set meat before him to eat: but he said, I will<br>
           not eat, until I have told mine errand. And he said, Speak on.</p>

<p> And he said, I am Abraham's servant.</p>

<p> And the LORD hath blessed my master greatly; and he is become<br>
           great: and he hath given him flocks, and herds, and silver,<br>
           and gold, and menservants, and maidservants, and camels, and<br>
           asses.</p>

<p> And Sarah my master's wife bare a son to my master when she<br>
           was old: and unto him hath he given all that he hath.</p>

<p> And my master made me swear, saying, Thou shalt not take a<br>
           wife to my son of the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose<br>
           land I dwell:</p>

<p> But thou shalt go unto my father's house, and to my kindred,<br>
           and take a wife unto my son.</p>

<p> And I said unto my master, Peradventure the woman will not<br>
           follow me.</p>

<p> And he said unto me, The LORD, before whom I walk, will send<br>
           his angel with thee, and prosper thy way; and thou shalt take<br>
           a wife for my son of my kindred, and of my father's house:</p>

<p> Then shalt thou be clear from this my oath, when thou comest<br>
           to my kindred; and if they give not thee one, thou shalt be<br>
           clear from my oath.</p>

<p> And I came this day unto the well, and said, O LORD God of my<br>
           master Abraham, if now thou do prosper my way which I go:</p>

<p> Behold, I stand by the well of water; and it shall come to<br>
           pass, that when the virgin cometh forth to draw water, and I<br>
           say to her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water of thy<br>
           pitcher to drink;</p>

<p> And she say to me, Both drink thou, and I will also draw for<br>
           thy camels: let the same be the woman whom the LORD hath<br>
           appointed out for my master's son.</p>

<p> And before I had done speaking in mine heart, behold, Rebekah<br>
           came forth with her pitcher on her shoulder; and she went down<br>
           unto the well, and drew water: and I said unto her, Let me<br>
           drink, I pray thee.</p>

<p> And she made haste, and let down her pitcher from her<br>
           shoulder, and said, Drink, and I will give thy camels drink<br>
           also: so I drank, and she made the camels drink also.</p>

<p> And I asked her, and said, Whose daughter art thou? And she<br>
           said, the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bare<br>
           unto him: and I put the earring upon her face, and the<br>
           bracelets upon her hands.</p>

<p> And I bowed down my head, and worshipped the LORD, and blessed<br>
           the LORD God of my master Abraham, which had led me in the<br>
           right way to take my master's brother's daughter unto his son.</p>

<p> And now if ye will deal kindly and truly with my master, tell<br>
           me: and if not, tell me; that I may turn to the right hand, or<br>
           to the left.</p>

<p> Then Laban and Bethuel answered and said, The thing proceedeth<br>
           from the LORD: we cannot speak unto thee bad or good.</p>

<p> Behold, Rebekah is before thee, take her, and go, and let her<br>
           be thy master's son's wife, as the LORD hath spoken.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, that, when Abraham's servant heard their<br>
           words, he worshipped the LORD, bowing himself to the earth.</p>

<p> And the servant brought forth jewels of silver, and jewels of<br>
           gold, and raiment, and gave them to Rebekah: he gave also to<br>
           her brother and to her mother precious things.</p>

<p> And they did eat and drink, he and the men that were with him,<br>
           and tarried all night; and they rose up in the morning, and he<br>
           said, Send me away unto my master.</p>

<p> And her brother and her mother said, Let the damsel abide with<br>
           us a few days, at the least ten; after that she shall go.</p>

<p> And he said unto them, Hinder me not, seeing the LORD hath<br>
           prospered my way; send me away that I may go to my master.</p>

<p> And they said, We will call the damsel, and enquire at her<br>
           mouth.</p>

<p> And they called Rebekah, and said unto her, Wilt thou go with<br>
           this man? And she said, I will go.</p>

<p> And they sent away Rebekah their sister, and her nurse, and<br>
           Abraham's servant, and his men.</p>

<p> And they blessed Rebekah, and said unto her, Thou art our<br>
           sister, be thou the mother of thousands of millions, and let<br>
           thy seed possess the gate of those which hate them.</p>

<p> And Rebekah arose, and her damsels, and they rode upon the<br>
           camels, and followed the man: and the servant took Rebekah,<br>
           and went his way.</p>

<p> And Isaac came from the way of the well Lahairoi; for he dwelt<br>
           in the south country.</p>

<p> And Isaac went out to meditate in the field at the eventide:<br>
           and he lifted up his eyes, and saw, and, behold, the camels<br>
           were coming.</p>

<p> And Rebekah lifted up her eyes, and when she saw Isaac, she<br>
           lighted off the camel.</p>

<p> For she had said unto the servant, What man is this that<br>
           walketh in the field to meet us? And the servant had said, It<br>
           is my master: therefore she took a vail, and covered herself.</p>

<p> And the servant told Isaac all things that he had done.</p>

<p> And Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah's tent, and took<br>
           Rebekah, and she became his wife; and he loved her: and Isaac<br>
           was comforted after his mother's death.</p>

<p> Then again Abraham took a wife, and her name was Keturah.</p>

<p> And she bare him Zimran, and Jokshan, and Medan, and Midian,<br>
           and Ishbak, and Shuah.</p>

<p> And Jokshan begat Sheba, and Dedan. And the sons of Dedan were<br>
           Asshurim, and Letushim, and Leummim.</p>

<p> And the sons of Midian; Ephah, and Epher, and Hanoch, and<br>
           Abidah, and Eldaah. All these were the children of Keturah.</p>

<p> And Abraham gave all that he had unto Isaac.</p>

<p> But unto the sons of the concubines, which Abraham had,<br>
           Abraham gave gifts, and sent them away from Isaac his son,<br>
           while he yet lived, eastward, unto the east country.</p>

<p> And these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he<br>
           lived, an hundred threescore and fifteen years.</p>

<p> Then Abraham gave up the ghost, and died in a good old age, an<br>
           old man, and full of years; and was gathered to his people.</p>

<p> And his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of<br>
           Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the<br>
           Hittite, which is before Mamre;</p>

<p> The field which Abraham purchased of the sons of Heth: there<br>
           was Abraham buried, and Sarah his wife.</p>

<p> And it came to pass after the death of Abraham, that God<br>
           blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac dwelt by the well Lahairoi.</p>

<p> Now these are the generations of Ishmael, Abraham's son, whom<br>
           Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah's handmaid, bare unto Abraham:</p>

<p> And these are the names of the sons of Ishmael, by their<br>
           names, according to their generations: the firstborn of<br>
           Ishmael, Nebajoth; and Kedar, and Adbeel, and Mibsam,</p>

<p> And Mishma, and Dumah, and Massa,</p>

<p> Hadar, and Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah:</p>

<p> These are the sons of Ishmael, and these are their names, by<br>
           their towns, and by their castles; twelve princes according to<br>
           their nations.</p>

<p> And these are the years of the life of Ishmael, an hundred and<br>
           thirty and seven years: and he gave up the ghost and died; and<br>
           was gathered unto his people.</p>

<p> And they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt,<br>
           as thou goest toward Assyria: and he died in the presence of<br>
           all his brethren.</p>

<p> And these are the generations of Isaac, Abraham's son: Abraham<br>
           begat Isaac:</p>

<p> And Isaac was forty years old when he took Rebekah to wife,<br>
           the daughter of Bethuel the Syrian of Padanaram, the sister to<br>
           Laban the Syrian.</p>

<p> And Isaac intreated the LORD for his wife, because she was<br>
           barren: and the LORD was intreated of him, and Rebekah his<br>
           wife conceived.</p>

<p> And the children struggled together within her; and she said,<br>
           If it be so, why am I thus? And she went to enquire of the<br>
           LORD.</p>

<p> And the LORD said unto her, Two nations are in thy womb, and<br>
           two manner of people shall be separated from thy bowels; and<br>
           the one people shall be stronger than the other people; and<br>
           the elder shall serve the younger.</p>

<p> And when her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold,<br>
           there were twins in her womb.</p>

<p> And the first came out red, all over like an hairy garment;<br>
           and they called his name Esau.</p>

<p> And after that came his brother out, and his hand took hold on<br>
           Esau's heel; and his name was called Jacob: and Isaac was<br>
           threescore years old when she bare them.</p>

<p> And the boys grew: and Esau was a cunning hunter, a man of the<br>
           field; and Jacob was a plain man, dwelling in tents.</p>

<p> And Isaac loved Esau, because he did eat of his venison: but<br>
           Rebekah loved Jacob.</p>

<p> And Jacob sod pottage: and Esau came from the field, and he<br>
           was faint:</p>

<p> And Esau said to Jacob, Feed me, I pray thee, with that same<br>
           red pottage; for I am faint: therefore was his name called<br>
           Edom.</p>

<p> And Jacob said, Sell me this day thy birthright.</p>

<p> And Esau said, Behold, I am at the point to die: and what<br>
           profit shall this birthright do to me?</p>

<p> And Jacob said, Swear to me this day; and he sware unto him:<br>
           and he sold his birthright unto Jacob.</p>

<p> Then Jacob gave Esau bread and pottage of lentiles; and he did<br>
           eat and drink, and rose up, and went his way: thus Esau<br>
           despised his birthright.</p>

<p> And there was a famine in the land, beside the first famine<br>
           that was in the days of Abraham. And Isaac went unto Abimelech<br>
           king of the Philistines unto Gerar.</p>

<p> And the LORD appeared unto him, and said, Go not down into<br>
           Egypt; dwell in the land which I shall tell thee of:</p>

<p> Sojourn in this land, and I will be with thee, and will bless<br>
           thee; for unto thee, and unto thy seed, I will give all these<br>
           countries, and I will perform the oath which I sware unto<br>
           Abraham thy father;</p>

<p> And I will make thy seed to multiply as the stars of heaven,<br>
           and will give unto thy seed all these countries; and in thy<br>
           seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed;</p>

<p> Because that Abraham obeyed my voice, and kept my charge, my<br>
           commandments, my statutes, and my laws.</p>

<p> And Isaac dwelt in Gerar:</p>

<p> And the men of the place asked him of his wife; and he said,<br>
           She is my sister: for he feared to say, She is my wife; lest,<br>
           said he, the men of the place should kill me for Rebekah;<br>
           because she was fair to look upon.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, when he had been there a long time, that<br>
           Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out at a window, and<br>
           saw, and, behold, Isaac was sporting with Rebekah his wife.</p>

<p> And Abimelech called Isaac, and said, Behold, of a surety she<br>
           is thy wife; and how saidst thou, She is my sister? And Isaac<br>
           said unto him, Because I said, Lest I die for her.</p>

<p> And Abimelech said, What is this thou hast done unto us? one<br>
           of the people might lightly have lien with thy wife, and thou<br>
           shouldest have brought guiltiness upon us.</p>

<p> And Abimelech charged all his people, saying, He that toucheth<br>
           this man or his wife shall surely be put to death.</p>

<p> Then Isaac sowed in that land, and received in the same year<br>
           an hundredfold: and the LORD blessed him.</p>

<p> And the man waxed great, and went forward, and grew until he<br>
           became very great:</p>

<p> For he had possession of flocks, and possession of herds, and<br>
           great store of servants: and the Philistines envied him.</p>

<p> For all the wells which his father's servants had digged in<br>
           the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines had stopped<br>
           them, and filled them with earth.</p>

<p> And Abimelech said unto Isaac, Go from us; for thou art much<br>
           mightier than we.</p>

<p> And Isaac departed thence, and pitched his tent in the valley<br>
           of Gerar, and dwelt there.</p>

<p> And Isaac digged again the wells of water, which they had<br>
           digged in the days of Abraham his father; for the Philistines<br>
           had stopped them after the death of Abraham: and he called<br>
           their names after the names by which his father had called<br>
           them.</p>

<p> And Isaac's servants digged in the valley, and found there a<br>
           well of springing water.</p>

<p> And the herdmen of Gerar did strive with Isaac's herdmen,<br>
           saying, The water is ours: and he called the name of the well<br>
           Esek; because they strove with him.</p>

<p> And they digged another well, and strove for that also: and he<br>
           called the name of it Sitnah.</p>

<p> And he removed from thence, and digged another well; and for<br>
           that they strove not: and he called the name of it Rehoboth;<br>
           and he said, For now the LORD hath made room for us, and we<br>
           shall be fruitful in the land.</p>

<p> And he went up from thence to Beersheba.</p>

<p> And the LORD appeared unto him the same night, and said, I am<br>
           the God of Abraham thy father: fear not, for I am with thee,<br>
           and will bless thee, and multiply thy seed for my servant<br>
           Abraham's sake.</p>

<p> And he builded an altar there, and called upon the name of the<br>
           LORD, and pitched his tent there: and there Isaac's servants<br>
           digged a well.</p>

<p> Then Abimelech went to him from Gerar, and Ahuzzath one of his<br>
           friends, and Phichol the chief captain of his army.</p>

<p> And Isaac said unto them, Wherefore come ye to me, seeing ye<br>
           hate me, and have sent me away from you?</p>

<p> And they said, We saw certainly that the LORD was with thee:<br>
           and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt<br>
           us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee;</p>

<p> That thou wilt do us no hurt, as we have not touched thee, and<br>
           as we have done unto thee nothing but good, and have sent thee<br>
           away in peace: thou art now the blessed of the LORD.</p>

<p> And he made them a feast, and they did eat and drink.</p>

<p> And they rose up betimes in the morning, and sware one to<br>
           another: and Isaac sent them away, and they departed from him<br>
           in peace.</p>

<p> And it came to pass the same day, that Isaac's servants came,<br>
           and told him concerning the well which they had digged, and<br>
           said unto him, We have found water.</p>

<p> And he called it Shebah: therefore the name of the city is<br>
           Beersheba unto this day.</p>

<p> And Esau was forty years old when he took to wife Judith the<br>
           daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Bashemath the daughter of<br>
           Elon the Hittite:</p>

<p> Which were a grief of mind unto Isaac and to Rebekah.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, that when Isaac was old, and his eyes<br>
           were dim, so that he could not see, he called Esau his eldest<br>
           son, and said unto him, My son: and he said unto him, Behold,<br>
           here am I.</p>

<p> And he said, Behold now, I am old, I know not the day of my<br>
           death:</p>

<p> Now therefore take, I pray thee, thy weapons, thy quiver and<br>
           thy bow, and go out to the field, and take me some venison;</p>

<p> And make me savoury meat, such as I love, and bring it to me,<br>
           that I may eat; that my soul may bless thee before I die.</p>

<p> And Rebekah heard when Isaac spake to Esau his son. And Esau<br>
           went to the field to hunt for venison, and to bring it.</p>

<p> And Rebekah spake unto Jacob her son, saying, Behold, I heard<br>
           thy father speak unto Esau thy brother, saying,</p>

<p> Bring me venison, and make me savoury meat, that I may eat,<br>
           and bless thee before the LORD before my death.</p>

<p> Now therefore, my son, obey my voice according to that which I<br>
           command thee.</p>

<p> Go now to the flock, and fetch me from thence two good kids of<br>
           the goats; and I will make them savoury meat for thy father,<br>
           such as he loveth:</p>

<p> And thou shalt bring it to thy father, that he may eat, and<br>
           that he may bless thee before his death.</p>

<p> And Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, Behold, Esau my brother<br>
           is a hairy man, and I am a smooth man:</p>

<p> My father peradventure will feel me, and I shall seem to him<br>
           as a deceiver; and I shall bring a curse upon me, and not a<br>
           blessing.</p>

<p> And his mother said unto him, Upon me be thy curse, my son:<br>
           only obey my voice, and go fetch me them.</p>

<p> And he went, and fetched, and brought them to his mother: and<br>
           his mother made savoury meat, such as his father loved.</p>

<p> And Rebekah took goodly raiment of her eldest son Esau, which<br>
           were with her in the house, and put them upon Jacob her<br>
           younger son:</p>

<p> And she put the skins of the kids of the goats upon his hands,<br>
           and upon the smooth of his neck:</p>

<p> And she gave the savoury meat and the bread, which she had<br>
           prepared, into the hand of her son Jacob.</p>

<p> And he came unto his father, and said, My father: and he said,<br>
           Here am I; who art thou, my son?</p>

<p> And Jacob said unto his father, I am Esau thy first born; I<br>
           have done according as thou badest me: arise, I pray thee, sit<br>
           and eat of my venison, that thy soul may bless me.</p>

<p> And Isaac said unto his son, How is it that thou hast found it<br>
           so quickly, my son? And he said, Because the LORD thy God<br>
           brought it to me.</p>

<p> And Isaac said unto Jacob, Come near, I pray thee, that I may<br>
           feel thee, my son, whether thou be my very son Esau or not.</p>

<p> And Jacob went near unto Isaac his father; and he felt him,<br>
           and said, The voice is Jacob's voice, but the hands are the<br>
           hands of Esau.</p>

<p> And he discerned him not, because his hands were hairy, as his<br>
           brother Esau's hands: so he blessed him.</p>

<p> And he said, Art thou my very son Esau? And he said, I am.</p>

<p> And he said, Bring it near to me, and I will eat of my son's<br>
           venison, that my soul may bless thee. And he brought it near<br>
           to him, and he did eat: and he brought him wine and he drank.</p>

<p> And his father Isaac said unto him, Come near now, and kiss<br>
           me, my son.</p>

<p> And he came near, and kissed him: and he smelled the smell of<br>
           his raiment, and blessed him, and said, See, the smell of my<br>
           son is as the smell of a field which the LORD hath blessed:</p>

<p> Therefore God give thee of the dew of heaven, and the fatness<br>
           of the earth, and plenty of corn and wine:</p>

<p> Let people serve thee, and nations bow down to thee: be lord<br>
           over thy brethren, and let thy mother's sons bow down to thee:<br>
           cursed be every one that curseth thee, and blessed be he that<br>
           blesseth thee.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, as soon as Isaac had made an end of<br>
           blessing Jacob, and Jacob was yet scarce gone out from the<br>
           presence of Isaac his father, that Esau his brother came in<br>
           from his hunting.</p>

<p> And he also had made savoury meat, and brought it unto his<br>
           father, and said unto his father, Let my father arise, and eat<br>
           of his son's venison, that thy soul may bless me.</p>

<p> And Isaac his father said unto him, Who art thou? And he said,<br>
           I am thy son, thy firstborn Esau.</p>

<p> And Isaac trembled very exceedingly, and said, Who? where is<br>
           he that hath taken venison, and brought it me, and I have<br>
           eaten of all before thou camest, and have blessed him? yea,<br>
           and he shall be blessed.</p>

<p> And when Esau heard the words of his father, he cried with a<br>
           great and exceeding bitter cry, and said unto his father,<br>
           Bless me, even me also, O my father.</p>

<p> And he said, Thy brother came with subtilty, and hath taken<br>
           away thy blessing.</p>

<p> And he said, Is not he rightly named Jacob? for he hath<br>
           supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright;<br>
           and, behold, now he hath taken away my blessing. And he said,<br>
           Hast thou not reserved a blessing for me?</p>

<p> And Isaac answered and said unto Esau, Behold, I have made him<br>
           thy lord, and all his brethren have I given to him for<br>
           servants; and with corn and wine have I sustained him: and<br>
           what shall I do now unto thee, my son?</p>

<p> And Esau said unto his father, Hast thou but one blessing, my<br>
           father? bless me, even me also, O my father. And Esau lifted<br>
           up his voice, and wept.</p>

<p> And Isaac his father answered and said unto him, Behold, thy<br>
           dwelling shall be the fatness of the earth, and of the dew of<br>
           heaven from above;</p>

<p> And by thy sword shalt thou live, and shalt serve thy brother;<br>
           and it shall come to pass when thou shalt have the dominion,<br>
           that thou shalt break his yoke from off thy neck.</p>

<p> And Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing wherewith his<br>
           father blessed him: and Esau said in his heart, The days of<br>
           mourning for my father are at hand; then will I slay my<br>
           brother Jacob.</p>

<p> And these words of Esau her elder son were told to Rebekah:<br>
           and she sent and called Jacob her younger son, and said unto<br>
           him, Behold, thy brother Esau, as touching thee, doth comfort<br>
           himself, purposing to kill thee.</p>

<p> Now therefore, my son, obey my voice; arise, flee thou to<br>
           Laban my brother to Haran;</p>

<p> And tarry with him a few days, until thy brother's fury turn<br>
           away;</p>

<p> Until thy brother's anger turn away from thee, and he forget<br>
           that which thou hast done to him: then I will send, and fetch<br>
           thee from thence: why should I be deprived also of you both in<br>
           one day?</p>

<p> And Rebekah said to Isaac, I am weary of my life because of<br>
           the daughters of Heth: if Jacob take a wife of the daughters<br>
           of Heth, such as these which are of the daughters of the land,<br>
           what good shall my life do me?</p>

<p> And Isaac called Jacob, and blessed him, and charged him, and<br>
           said unto him, Thou shalt not take a wife of the daughters of<br>
           Canaan.</p>

<p> Arise, go to Padanaram, to the house of Bethuel thy mother's<br>
           father; and take thee a wife from thence of the daughers of<br>
           Laban thy mother's brother.</p>

<p> And God Almighty bless thee, and make thee fruitful, and<br>
           multiply thee, that thou mayest be a multitude of people;</p>

<p> And give thee the blessing of Abraham, to thee, and to thy<br>
           seed with thee; that thou mayest inherit the land wherein thou<br>
           art a stranger, which God gave unto Abraham.</p>

<p> And Isaac sent away Jacob: and he went to Padanaram unto<br>
           Laban, son of Bethuel the Syrian, the brother of Rebekah,<br>
           Jacob's and Esau's mother.</p>

<p> When Esau saw that Isaac had blessed Jacob, and sent him away<br>
           to Padanaram, to take him a wife from thence; and that as he<br>
           blessed him he gave him a charge, saying, Thou shalt not take<br>
           a wife of the daughers of Canaan;</p>

<p> And that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother, and was gone<br>
           to Padanaram;</p>

<p> And Esau seeing that the daughters of Canaan pleased not Isaac<br>
           his father;</p>

<p> Then went Esau unto Ishmael, and took unto the wives which he<br>
           had Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael Abraham's son, the sister<br>
           of Nebajoth, to be his wife.</p>

<p> And Jacob went out from Beersheba, and went toward Haran.</p>

<p> And he lighted upon a certain place, and tarried there all<br>
           night, because the sun was set; and he took of the stones of<br>
           that place, and put them for his pillows, and lay down in that<br>
           place to sleep.</p>

<p> And he dreamed, and behold a ladder set up on the earth, and<br>
           the top of it reached to heaven: and behold the angels of God<br>
           ascending and descending on it.</p>

<p> And, behold, the LORD stood above it, and said, I am the LORD<br>
           God of Abraham thy father, and the God of Isaac: the land<br>
           whereon thou liest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed;</p>

<p> And thy seed shall be as the dust of the earth, and thou shalt<br>
           spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north,<br>
           and to the south: and in thee and in thy seed shall all the<br>
           families of the earth be blessed.</p>

<p> And, behold, I am with thee, and will keep thee in all places<br>
           whither thou goest, and will bring thee again into this land;<br>
           for I will not leave thee, until I have done that which I have<br>
           spoken to thee of.</p>

<p> And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, Surely the<br>
           LORD is in this place; and I knew it not.</p>

<p> And he was afraid, and said, How dreadful is this place! this<br>
           is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of<br>
           heaven.</p>

<p> And Jacob rose up early in the morning, and took the stone<br>
           that he had put for his pillows, and set it up for a pillar,<br>
           and poured oil upon the top of it.</p>

<p> And he called the name of that place Bethel: but the name of<br>
           that city was called Luz at the first.</p>

<p> And Jacob vowed a vow, saying, If God will be with me, and<br>
           will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to<br>
           eat, and raiment to put on,</p>

<p> So that I come again to my father's house in peace; then shall<br>
           the LORD be my God:</p>

<p> And this stone, which I have set for a pillar, shall be God's<br>
           house: and of all that thou shalt give me I will surely give<br>
           the tenth unto thee.</p>

<p> Then Jacob went on his journey, and came into the land of the<br>
           people of the east.</p>

<p> And he looked, and behold a well in the field, and, lo, there<br>
           were three flocks of sheep lying by it; for out of that well<br>
           they watered the flocks: and a great stone was upon the well's<br>
           mouth.</p>

<p> And thither were all the flocks gathered: and they rolled the<br>
           stone from the well's mouth, and watered the sheep, and put<br>
           the stone again upon the well's mouth in his place.</p>

<p> And Jacob said unto them, My brethren, whence be ye? And they<br>
           said, Of Haran are we.</p>

<p> And he said unto them, Know ye Laban the son of Nahor? And<br>
           they said, We know him.</p>

<p> And he said unto them, Is he well? And they said, He is well:<br>
           and, behold, Rachel his daughter cometh with the sheep.</p>

<p> And he said, Lo, it is yet high day, neither is it time that<br>
           the cattle should be gathered together: water ye the sheep,<br>
           and go and feed them.</p>

<p> And they said, We cannot, until all the flocks be gathered<br>
           together, and till they roll the stone from the well's mouth;<br>
           then we water the sheep.</p>

<p> And while he yet spake with them, Rachel came with her<br>
           father's sheep; for she kept them.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, when Jacob saw Rachel the daughter of<br>
           Laban his mother's brother, and the sheep of Laban his<br>
           mother's brother, that Jacob went near, and rolled the stone<br>
           from the well's mouth, and watered the flock of Laban his<br>
           mother's brother.</p>

<p> And Jacob kissed Rachel, and lifted up his voice, and wept.</p>

<p> And Jacob told Rachel that he was her father's brother, and<br>
           that he was Rebekah's son: and she ran and told her father.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, when Laban heard the tidings of Jacob his<br>
           sister's son, that he ran to meet him, and embraced him, and<br>
           kissed him, and brought him to his house. And he told Laban<br>
           all these things.</p>

<p> And Laban said to him, Surely thou art my bone and my flesh.<br>
           And he abode with him the space of a month.</p>

<p> And Laban said unto Jacob, Because thou art my brother,<br>
           shouldest thou therefore serve me for nought? tell me, what<br>
           shall thy wages be?</p>

<p> And Laban had two daughters: the name of the elder was Leah,<br>
           and the name of the younger was Rachel.</p>

<p> Leah was tender eyed; but Rachel was beautiful and well<br>
           favoured.</p>

<p> And Jacob loved Rachel; and said, I will serve thee seven<br>
           years for Rachel thy younger daughter.</p>

<p> And Laban said, It is better that I give her to thee, than<br>
           that I should give her to another man: abide with me.</p>

<p> And Jacob served seven years for Rachel; and they seemed unto<br>
           him but a few days, for the love he had to her.</p>

<p> And Jacob said unto Laban, Give me my wife, for my days are<br>
           fulfilled, that I may go in unto her.</p>

<p> And Laban gathered together all the men of the place, and made<br>
           a feast.</p>

<p> And it came to pass in the evening, that he took Leah his<br>
           daughter, and brought her to him; and he went in unto her.</p>

<p> And Laban gave unto his daughter Leah Zilpah his maid for an<br>
           handmaid.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, that in the morning, behold, it was Leah:<br>
           and he said to Laban, What is this thou hast done unto me? did<br>
           not I serve with thee for Rachel? wherefore then hast thou<br>
           beguiled me?</p>

<p> And Laban said, It must not be so done in our country, to give<br>
           the younger before the firstborn.</p>

<p> Fulfil her week, and we will give thee this also for the<br>
           service which thou shalt serve with me yet seven other years.</p>

<p> And Jacob did so, and fulfilled her week: and he gave him<br>
           Rachel his daughter to wife also.</p>

<p> And Laban gave to Rachel his daughter Bilhah his handmaid to<br>
           be her maid.</p>

<p> And he went in also unto Rachel, and he loved also Rachel more<br>
           than Leah, and served with him yet seven other years.</p>

<p> And when the LORD saw that Leah was hated, he opened her womb:<br>
           but Rachel was barren.</p>

<p> And Leah conceived, and bare a son, and she called his name<br>
           Reuben: for she said, Surely the LORD hath looked upon my<br>
           affliction; now therefore my husband will love me.</p>

<p> And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Because the<br>
           LORD hath heard I was hated, he hath therefore given me this<br>
           son also: and she called his name Simeon.</p>

<p> And she conceived again, and bare a son; and said, Now this<br>
           time will my husband be joined unto me, because I have born<br>
           him three sons: therefore was his name called Levi.</p>

<p> And she conceived again, and bare a son: and she said, Now<br>
           will I praise the LORD: therefore she called his name Judah;<br>
           and left bearing.</p>

<p> And when Rachel saw that she bare Jacob no children, Rachel<br>
           envied her sister; and said unto Jacob, Give me children, or<br>
           else I die.</p>

<p> And Jacob's anger was kindled against Rachel: and he said, Am<br>
           I in God's stead, who hath withheld from thee the fruit of the<br>
           womb?</p>

<p> And she said, Behold my maid Bilhah, go in unto her; and she<br>
           shall bear upon my knees, that I may also have children by<br>
           her.</p>

<p> And she gave him Bilhah her handmaid to wife: and Jacob went<br>
           in unto her.</p>

<p> And Bilhah conceived, and bare Jacob a son.</p>

<p> And Rachel said, God hath judged me, and hath also heard my<br>
           voice, and hath given me a son: therefore called she his name<br>
           Dan.</p>

<p> And Bilhah Rachel's maid conceived again, and bare Jacob a<br>
           second son.</p>

<p> And Rachel said, With great wrestlings have I wrestled with my<br>
           sister, and I have prevailed: and she called his name<br>
           Naphtali.</p>

<p> When Leah saw that she had left bearing, she took Zilpah her<br>
           maid, and gave her Jacob to wife.</p>

<p> And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a son.</p>

<p> And Leah said, A troop cometh: and she called his name Gad.</p>

<p> And Zilpah Leah's maid bare Jacob a second son.</p>

<p> And Leah said, Happy am I, for the daughters will call me<br>
           blessed: and she called his name Asher.</p>

<p> And Reuben went in the days of wheat harvest, and found<br>
           mandrakes in the field, and brought them unto his mother Leah.<br>
           Then Rachel said to Leah, Give me, I pray thee, of thy son's<br>
           mandrakes.</p>

<p> And she said unto her, Is it a small matter that thou hast<br>
           taken my husband? and wouldest thou take away my son's<br>
           mandrakes also? And Rachel said, Therefore he shall lie with<br>
           thee to night for thy son's mandrakes.</p>

<p> And Jacob came out of the field in the evening, and Leah went<br>
           out to meet him, and said, Thou must come in unto me; for<br>
           surely I have hired thee with my son's mandrakes. And he lay<br>
           with her that night.</p>

<p> And God hearkened unto Leah, and she conceived, and bare Jacob<br>
           the fifth son.</p>

<p> And Leah said, God hath given me my hire, because I have given<br>
           my maiden to my husband: and she called his name Issachar.</p>

<p> And Leah conceived again, and bare Jacob the sixth son.</p>

<p> And Leah said, God hath endued me with a good dowry; now will<br>
           my husband dwell with me, because I have born him six sons:<br>
           and she called his name Zebulun.</p>

<p> And afterwards she bare a daughter, and called her name Dinah.</p>

<p> And God remembered Rachel, and God hearkened to her, and<br>
           opened her womb.</p>

<p> And she conceived, and bare a son; and said, God hath taken<br>
           away my reproach:</p>

<p> And she called his name Joseph; and said, The LORD shall add<br>
           to me another son.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, when Rachel had born Joseph, that Jacob<br>
           said unto Laban, Send me away, that I may go unto mine own<br>
           place, and to my country.</p>

<p> Give me my wives and my children, for whom I have served thee,<br>
           and let me go: for thou knowest my service which I have done<br>
           thee.</p>

<p> And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favour<br>
           in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that<br>
           the LORD hath blessed me for thy sake.</p>

<p> And he said, Appoint me thy wages, and I will give it.</p>

<p> And he said unto him, Thou knowest how I have served thee, and<br>
           how thy cattle was with me.</p>

<p> For it was little which thou hadst before I came, and it is<br>
           now increased unto a multitude; and the LORD hath blessed thee<br>
           since my coming: and now when shall I provide for mine own<br>
           house also?</p>

<p> And he said, What shall I give thee? And Jacob said, Thou<br>
           shalt not give me any thing: if thou wilt do this thing for<br>
           me, I will again feed and keep thy flock.</p>

<p> I will pass through all thy flock to day, removing from thence<br>
           all the speckled and spotted cattle, and all the brown cattle<br>
           among the sheep, and the spotted and speckled among the goats:<br>
           and of such shall be my hire.</p>

<p> So shall my righteousness answer for me in time to come, when<br>
           it shall come for my hire before thy face: every one that is<br>
           not speckled and spotted among the goats, and brown among the<br>
           sheep, that shall be counted stolen with me.</p>

<p> And Laban said, Behold, I would it might be according to thy<br>
           word.</p>

<p> And he removed that day the he goats that were ringstraked and<br>
           spotted, and all the she goats that were speckled and spotted,<br>
           and every one that had some white in it, and all the brown<br>
           among the sheep, and gave them into the hand of his sons.</p>

<p> And he set three days' journey betwixt himself and Jacob: and<br>
           Jacob fed the rest of Laban's flocks.</p>

<p> And Jacob took him rods of green poplar, and of the hazel and<br>
           chesnut tree; and pilled white strakes in them, and made the<br>
           white appear which was in the rods.</p>

<p> And he set the rods which he had pilled before the flocks in<br>
           the gutters in the watering troughs when the flocks came to<br>
           drink, that they should conceive when they came to drink.</p>

<p> And the flocks conceived before the rods, and brought forth<br>
           cattle ringstraked, speckled, and spotted.</p>

<p> And Jacob did separate the lambs, and set the faces of the<br>
           flocks toward the ringstraked, and all the brown in the flock<br>
           of Laban; and he put his own flocks by themselves, and put<br>
           them not unto Laban's cattle.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, whensoever the stronger cattle did<br>
           conceive, that Jacob laid the rods before the eyes of the<br>
           cattle in the gutters, that they might conceive among the<br>
           rods.</p>

<p> But when the cattle were feeble, he put them not in: so the<br>
           feebler were Laban's, and the stronger Jacob's.</p>

<p> And the man increased exceedingly, and had much cattle, and<br>
           maidservants, and menservants, and camels, and asses.</p>

<p> And he heard the words of Laban's sons, saying, Jacob hath<br>
           taken away all that was our father's; and of that which was<br>
           our father's hath he gotten all this glory.</p>

<p> And Jacob beheld the countenance of Laban, and, behold, it was<br>
           not toward him as before.</p>

<p> And the LORD said unto Jacob, Return unto the land of thy<br>
           fathers, and to thy kindred; and I will be with thee.</p>

<p> And Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to the field unto<br>
           his flock,</p>

<p> And said unto them, I see your father's countenance, that it<br>
           is not toward me as before; but the God of my father hath been<br>
           with me.</p>

<p> And ye know that with all my power I have served your father.</p>

<p> And your father hath deceived me, and changed my wages ten<br>
           times; but God suffered him not to hurt me.</p>

<p> If he said thus, The speckled shall be thy wages; then all the<br>
           cattle bare speckled: and if he said thus, The ringstraked<br>
           shall be thy hire; then bare all the cattle ringstraked.</p>

<p> Thus God hath taken away the cattle of your father, and given<br>
           them to me.</p>

<p> And it came to pass at the time that the cattle conceived,<br>
           that I lifted up mine eyes, and saw in a dream, and, behold,<br>
           the rams which leaped upon the cattle were ringstraked,<br>
           speckled, and grisled.</p>

<p> And the angel of God spake unto me in a dream, saying, Jacob:<br>
           And I said, Here am I.</p>

<p> And he said, Lift up now thine eyes, and see, all the rams<br>
           which leap upon the cattle are ringstraked, speckled, and<br>
           grisled: for I have seen all that Laban doeth unto thee.</p>

<p> I am the God of Bethel, where thou anointedst the pillar, and<br>
           where thou vowedst a vow unto me: now arise, get thee out from<br>
           this land, and return unto the land of thy kindred.</p>

<p> And Rachel and Leah answered and said unto him, Is there yet<br>
           any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house?</p>

<p> Are we not counted of him strangers? for he hath sold us, and<br>
           hath quite devoured also our money.</p>

<p> For all the riches which God hath taken from our father, that<br>
           is ours, and our children's: now then, whatsoever God hath<br>
           said unto thee, do.</p>

<p> Then Jacob rose up, and set his sons and his wives upon<br>
           camels;</p>

<p> And he carried away all his cattle, and all his goods which he<br>
           had gotten, the cattle of his getting, which he had gotten in<br>
           Padanaram, for to go to Isaac his father in the land of<br>
           Canaan.</p>

<p> And Laban went to shear his sheep: and Rachel had stolen the<br>
           images that were her father's.</p>

<p> And Jacob stole away unawares to Laban the Syrian, in that he<br>
           told him not that he fled.</p>

<p> So he fled with all that he had; and he rose up, and passed<br>
           over the river, and set his face toward the mount Gilead.</p>

<p> And it was told Laban on the third day that Jacob was fled.</p>

<p> And he took his brethren with him, and pursued after him seven<br>
           days' journey; and they overtook him in the mount Gilead.</p>

<p> And God came to Laban the Syrian in a dream by night, and said<br>
           unto him, Take heed that thou speak not to Jacob either good<br>
           or bad.</p>

<p> Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent in<br>
           the mount: and Laban with his brethren pitched in the mount of<br>
           Gilead.</p>

<p> And Laban said to Jacob, What hast thou done, that thou hast<br>
           stolen away unawares to me, and carried away my daughters, as<br>
           captives taken with the sword?</p>

<p> Wherefore didst thou flee away secretly, and steal away from<br>
           me; and didst not tell me, that I might have sent thee away<br>
           with mirth, and with songs, with tabret, and with harp?</p>

<p> And hast not suffered me to kiss my sons and my daughters?<br>
           thou hast now done foolishly in so doing.</p>

<p> It is in the power of my hand to do you hurt: but the God of<br>
           your father spake unto me yesternight, saying, Take thou heed<br>
           that thou speak not to Jacob either good or bad.</p>

<p> And now, though thou wouldest needs be gone, because thou sore<br>
           longedst after thy father's house, yet wherefore hast thou<br>
           stolen my gods?</p>

<p> And Jacob answered and said to Laban, Because I was afraid:<br>
           for I said, Peradventure thou wouldest take by force thy<br>
           daughters from me.</p>

<p> With whomsoever thou findest thy gods, let him not live:<br>
           before our brethren discern thou what is thine with me, and<br>
           take it to thee. For Jacob knew not that Rachel had stolen<br>
           them.</p>

<p> And Laban went into Jacob's tent, and into Leah's tent, and<br>
           into the two maidservants' tents; but he found them not. Then<br>
           went he out of Leah's tent, and entered into Rachel's tent.</p>

<p> Now Rachel had taken the images, and put them in the camel's<br>
           furniture, and sat upon them. And Laban searched all the tent,<br>
           but found them not.</p>

<p> And she said to her father, Let it not displease my lord that<br>
           I cannot rise up before thee; for the custom of women is upon<br>
           me. And he searched but found not the images.</p>

<p> And Jacob was wroth, and chode with Laban: and Jacob answered<br>
           and said to Laban, What is my trespass? what is my sin, that<br>
           thou hast so hotly pursued after me?</p>

<p> Whereas thou hast searched all my stuff, what hast thou found<br>
           of all thy household stuff? set it here before my brethren and<br>
           thy brethren, that they may judge betwixt us both.</p>

<p> This twenty years have I been with thee; thy ewes and thy she<br>
           goats have not cast their young, and the rams of thy flock<br>
           have I not eaten.</p>

<p> That which was torn of beasts I brought not unto thee; I bare<br>
           the loss of it; of my hand didst thou require it, whether<br>
           stolen by day, or stolen by night.</p>

<p> Thus I was; in the day the drought consumed me, and the frost<br>
           by night; and my sleep departed from mine eyes.</p>

<p> Thus have I been twenty years in thy house; I served thee<br>
           fourteen years for thy two daughters, and six years for thy<br>
           cattle: and thou hast changed my wages ten times.</p>

<p> Except the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and the fear<br>
           of Isaac, had been with me, surely thou hadst sent me away now<br>
           empty. God hath seen mine affliction and the labour of my<br>
           hands, and rebuked thee yesternight.</p>

<p> And Laban answered and said unto Jacob, These daughters are my<br>
           daughters, and these children are my children, and these<br>
           cattle are my cattle, and all that thou seest is mine: and<br>
           what can I do this day unto these my daughters, or unto their<br>
           children which they have born?</p>

<p> Now therefore come thou, let us make a covenant, I and thou;<br>
           and let it be for a witness between me and thee.</p>

<p> And Jacob took a stone, and set it up for a pillar.</p>

<p> And Jacob said unto his brethren, Gather stones; and they took<br>
           stones, and made an heap: and they did eat there upon the<br>
           heap.</p>

<p> And Laban called it Jegarsahadutha: but Jacob called it<br>
           Galeed.</p>

<p> And Laban said, This heap is a witness between me and thee<br>
           this day. Therefore was the name of it called Galeed;</p>

<p> And Mizpah; for he said, The LORD watch between me and thee,<br>
           when we are absent one from another.</p>

<p> If thou shalt afflict my daughters, or if thou shalt take<br>
           other wives beside my daughters, no man is with us; see, God<br>
           is witness betwixt me and thee.</p>

<p> And Laban said to Jacob, Behold this heap, and behold this<br>
           pillar, which I have cast betwixt me and thee:</p>

<p> This heap be witness, and this pillar be witness, that I will<br>
           not pass over this heap to thee, and that thou shalt not pass<br>
           over this heap and this pillar unto me, for harm.</p>

<p> The God of Abraham, and the God of Nahor, the God of their<br>
           father, judge betwixt us. And Jacob sware by the fear of his<br>
           father Isaac.</p>

<p> Then Jacob offered sacrifice upon the mount, and called his<br>
           brethren to eat bread: and they did eat bread, and tarried all<br>
           night in the mount.</p>

<p> And early in the morning Laban rose up, and kissed his sons<br>
           and his daughters, and blessed them: and Laban departed, and<br>
           returned unto his place.</p>

<p> And Jacob went on his way, and the angels of God met him.</p>

<p> And when Jacob saw them, he said, This is God's host: and he<br>
           called the name of that place Mahanaim.</p>

<p> And Jacob sent messengers before him to Esau his brother unto<br>
           the land of Seir, the country of Edom.</p>

<p> And he commanded them, saying, Thus shall ye speak unto my<br>
           lord Esau; Thy servant Jacob saith thus, I have sojourned with<br>
           Laban, and stayed there until now:</p>

<p> And I have oxen, and asses, flocks, and menservants, and<br>
           womenservants: and I have sent to tell my lord, that I may<br>
           find grace in thy sight.</p>

<p> And the messengers returned to Jacob, saying, We came to thy<br>
           brother Esau, and also he cometh to meet thee, and four<br>
           hundred men with him.</p>

<p> Then Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed: and he divided<br>
           the people that was with him, and the flocks, and herds, and<br>
           the camels, into two bands;</p>

<p> And said, If Esau come to the one company, and smite it, then<br>
           the other company which is left shall escape.</p>

<p> And Jacob said, O God of my father Abraham, and God of my<br>
           father Isaac, the LORD which saidst unto me, Return unto thy<br>
           country, and to thy kindred, and I will deal well with thee:</p>

<p> I am not worthy of the least of all the mercies, and of all<br>
           the truth, which thou hast shewed unto thy servant; for with<br>
           my staff I passed over this Jordan; and now I am become two<br>
           bands.</p>

<p> Deliver me, I pray thee, from the hand of my brother, from the<br>
           hand of Esau: for I fear him, lest he will come and smite me,<br>
           and the mother with the children.</p>

<p> And thou saidst, I will surely do thee good, and make thy seed<br>
           as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered for<br>
           multitude.</p>

<p> And he lodged there that same night; and took of that which<br>
           came to his hand a present for Esau his brother;</p>

<p> Two hundred she goats, and twenty he goats, two hundred ewes,<br>
           and twenty rams,</p>

<p> Thirty milch camels with their colts, forty kine, and ten<br>
           bulls, twenty she asses, and ten foals.</p>

<p> And he delivered them into the hand of his servants, every<br>
           drove by themselves; and said unto his servants, Pass over<br>
           before me, and put a space betwixt drove and drove.</p>

<p> And he commanded the foremost, saying, When Esau my brother<br>
           meeteth thee, and asketh thee, saying, Whose art thou? and<br>
           whither goest thou? and whose are these before thee?</p>

<p> Then thou shalt say, They be thy servant Jacob's; it is a<br>
           present sent unto my lord Esau: and, behold, also he is behind<br>
           us.</p>

<p> And so commanded he the second, and the third, and all that<br>
           followed the droves, saying, On this manner shall ye speak<br>
           unto Esau, when ye find him.</p>

<p> And say ye moreover, Behold, thy servant Jacob is behind us.<br>
           For he said, I will appease him with the present that goeth<br>
           before me, and afterward I will see his face; peradventure he<br>
           will accept of me.</p>

<p> So went the present over before him: and himself lodged that<br>
           night in the company.</p>

<p> And he rose up that night, and took his two wives, and his two<br>
           womenservants, and his eleven sons, and passed over the ford<br>
           Jabbok.</p>

<p> And he took them, and sent them over the brook, and sent over<br>
           that he had.</p>

<p> And Jacob was left alone; and there wrestled a man with him<br>
           until the breaking of the day.</p>

<p> And when he saw that he prevailed not against him, he touched<br>
           the hollow of his thigh; and the hollow of Jacob's thigh was<br>
           out of joint, as he wrestled with him.</p>

<p> And he said, Let me go, for the day breaketh. And he said, I<br>
           will not let thee go, except thou bless me.</p>

<p> And he said unto him, What is thy name? And he said, Jacob.</p>

<p> And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but<br>
           Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men,<br>
           and hast prevailed.</p>

<p> And Jacob asked him, and said, Tell me, I pray thee, thy name.<br>
           And he said, Wherefore is it that thou dost ask after my name?<br>
           And he blessed him there.</p>

<p> And Jacob called the name of the place Peniel: for I have seen<br>
           God face to face, and my life is preserved.</p>

<p> And as he passed over Penuel the sun rose upon him, and he<br>
           halted upon his thigh.</p>

<p> Therefore the children of Israel eat not of the sinew which<br>
           shrank, which is upon the hollow of the thigh, unto this day:<br>
           because he touched the hollow of Jacob's thigh in the sinew<br>
           that shrank.</p>

<p> And Jacob lifted up his eyes, and looked, and, behold, Esau<br>
           came, and with him four hundred men. And he divided the<br>
           children unto Leah, and unto Rachel, and unto the two<br>
           handmaids.</p>

<p> And he put the handmaids and their children foremost, and Leah<br>
           and her children after, and Rachel and Joseph hindermost.</p>

<p> And he passed over before them, and bowed himself to the<br>
           ground seven times, until he came near to his brother.</p>

<p> And Esau ran to meet him, and embraced him, and fell on his<br>
           neck, and kissed him: and they wept.</p>

<p> And he lifted up his eyes, and saw the women and the children;<br>
           and said, Who are those with thee? And he said, The children<br>
           which God hath graciously given thy servant.</p>

<p> Then the handmaidens came near, they and their children, and<br>
           they bowed themselves.</p>

<p> And Leah also with her children came near, and bowed<br>
           themselves: and after came Joseph near and Rachel, and they<br>
           bowed themselves.</p>

<p> And he said, What meanest thou by all this drove which I met?<br>
           And he said, These are to find grace in the sight of my lord.</p>

<p> And Esau said, I have enough, my brother; keep that thou hast<br>
           unto thyself.</p>

<p> And Jacob said, Nay, I pray thee, if now I have found grace in<br>
           thy sight, then receive my present at my hand: for therefore I<br>
           have seen thy face, as though I had seen the face of God, and<br>
           thou wast pleased with me.</p>

<p> Take, I pray thee, my blessing that is brought to thee;<br>
           because God hath dealt graciously with me, and because I have<br>
           enough. And he urged him, and he took it.</p>

<p> And he said, Let us take our journey, and let us go, and I<br>
           will go before thee.</p>

<p> And he said unto him, My lord knoweth that the children are<br>
           tender, and the flocks and herds with young are with me: and<br>
           if men should overdrive them one day, all the flock will die.</p>

<p> Let my lord, I pray thee, pass over before his servant: and I<br>
           will lead on softly, according as the cattle that goeth before<br>
           me and the children be able to endure, until I come unto my<br>
           lord unto Seir.</p>

<p> And Esau said, Let me now leave with thee some of the folk<br>
           that are with me. And he said, What needeth it? let me find<br>
           grace in the sight of my lord.</p>

<p> So Esau returned that day on his way unto Seir.</p>

<p> And Jacob journeyed to Succoth, and built him an house, and<br>
           made booths for his cattle: therefore the name of the place is<br>
           called Succoth.</p>

<p> And Jacob came to Shalem, a city of Shechem, which is in the<br>
           land of Canaan, when he came from Padanaram; and pitched his<br>
           tent before the city.</p>

<p> And he bought a parcel of a field, where he had spread his<br>
           tent, at the hand of the children of Hamor, Shechem's father,<br>
           for an hundred pieces of money.</p>

<p> And he erected there an altar, and called it EleloheIsrael.</p>

<p> And Dinah the daughter of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob,<br>
           went out to see the daughters of the land.</p>

<p> And when Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince of the<br>
           country, saw her, he took her, and lay with her, and defiled<br>
           her.</p>

<p> And his soul clave unto Dinah the daughter of Jacob, and he<br>
           loved the damsel, and spake kindly unto the damsel.</p>

<p> And Shechem spake unto his father Hamor, saying, Get me this<br>
           damsel to wife.</p>

<p> And Jacob heard that he had defiled Dinah his daughter: now<br>
           his sons were with his cattle in the field: and Jacob held his<br>
           peace until they were come.</p>

<p> And Hamor the father of Shechem went out unto Jacob to commune<br>
           with him.</p>

<p> And the sons of Jacob came out of the field when they heard<br>
           it: and the men were grieved, and they were very wroth,<br>
           because he had wrought folly in Israel in lying with Jacob's<br>
           daughter: which thing ought not to be done.</p>

<p> And Hamor communed with them, saying, The soul of my son<br>
           Shechem longeth for your daughter: I pray you give her him to<br>
           wife.</p>

<p> And make ye marriages with us, and give your daughters unto<br>
           us, and take our daughters unto you.</p>

<p> And ye shall dwell with us: and the land shall be before you;<br>
           dwell and trade ye therein, and get you possessions therein.</p>

<p> And Shechem said unto her father and unto her brethren, Let me<br>
           find grace in your eyes, and what ye shall say unto me I will<br>
           give.</p>

<p> Ask me never so much dowry and gift, and I will give according<br>
           as ye shall say unto me: but give me the damsel to wife.</p>

<p> And the sons of Jacob answered Shechem and Hamor his father<br>
           deceitfully, and said, because he had defiled Dinah their<br>
           sister:</p>

<p> And they said unto them, We cannot do this thing, to give our<br>
           sister to one that is uncircumcised; for that were a reproach<br>
           unto us:</p>

<p> But in this will we consent unto you: If ye will be as we be,<br>
           that every male of you be circumcised;</p>

<p> Then will we give our daughters unto you, and we will take<br>
           your daughters to us, and we will dwell with you, and we will<br>
           become one people.</p>

<p> But if ye will not hearken unto us, to be circumcised; then<br>
           will we take our daughter, and we will be gone.</p>

<p> And their words pleased Hamor, and Shechem Hamor's son.</p>

<p> And the young man deferred not to do the thing, because he had<br>
           delight in Jacob's daughter: and he was more honourable than<br>
           all the house of his father.</p>

<p> And Hamor and Shechem his son came unto the gate of their<br>
           city, and communed with the men of their city, saying,</p>

<p> These men are peaceable with us; therefore let them dwell in<br>
           the land, and trade therein; for the land, behold, it is large<br>
           enough for them; let us take their daughters to us for wives,<br>
           and let us give them our daughters.</p>

<p> Only herein will the men consent unto us for to dwell with us,<br>
           to be one people, if every male among us be circumcised, as<br>
           they are circumcised.</p>

<p> Shall not their cattle and their substance and every beast of<br>
           their's be our's? only let us consent unto them, and they will<br>
           dwell with us.</p>

<p> And unto Hamor and unto Shechem his son hearkened all that<br>
           went out of the gate of his city; and every male was<br>
           circumcised, all that went out of the gate of his city.</p>

<p> And it came to pass on the third day, when they were sore,<br>
           that two of the sons of Jacob, Simeon and Levi, Dinah's<br>
           brethren, took each man his sword, and came upon the city<br>
           boldly, and slew all the males.</p>

<p> And they slew Hamor and Shechem his son with the edge of the<br>
           sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem's house, and went out.</p>

<p> The sons of Jacob came upon the slain, and spoiled the city,<br>
           because they had defiled their sister.</p>

<p> They took their sheep, and their oxen, and their asses, and<br>
           that which was in the city, and that which was in the field,</p>

<p> And all their wealth, and all their little ones, and their<br>
           wives took they captive, and spoiled even all that was in the<br>
           house.</p>

<p> And Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, Ye have troubled me to make<br>
           me to stink among the inhabitants of the land, among the<br>
           Canaanites and the Perizzites: and I being few in number, they<br>
           shall gather themselves together against me, and slay me; and<br>
           I shall be destroyed, I and my house.</p>

<p> And they said, Should he deal with our sister as with an<br>
           harlot?</p>

<p> And God said unto Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell<br>
           there: and make there an altar unto God, that appeared unto<br>
           thee when thou fleddest from the face of Esau thy brother.</p>

<p> Then Jacob said unto his household, and to all that were with<br>
           him, Put away the strange gods that are among you, and be<br>
           clean, and change your garments:</p>

<p> And let us arise, and go up to Bethel; and I will make there<br>
           an altar unto God, who answered me in the day of my distress,<br>
           and was with me in the way which I went.</p>

<p> And they gave unto Jacob all the strange gods which were in<br>
           their hand, and all their earrings which were in their ears;<br>
           and Jacob hid them under the oak which was by Shechem.</p>

<p> And they journeyed: and the terror of God was upon the cities<br>
           that were round about them, and they did not pursue after the<br>
           sons of Jacob.</p>

<p> So Jacob came to Luz, which is in the land of Canaan, that is,<br>
           Bethel, he and all the people that were with him.</p>

<p> And he built there an altar, and called the place Elbethel:<br>
           because there God appeared unto him, when he fled from the<br>
           face of his brother.</p>

<p> But Deborah Rebekah's nurse died, and she was buried beneath<br>
           Bethel under an oak: and the name of it was called<br>
           Allonbachuth.</p>

<p> And God appeared unto Jacob again, when he came out of<br>
           Padanaram, and blessed him.</p>

<p> And God said unto him, Thy name is Jacob: thy name shall not<br>
           be called any more Jacob, but Israel shall be thy name: and he<br>
           called his name Israel.</p>

<p> And God said unto him, I am God Almighty: be fruitful and<br>
           multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee,<br>
           and kings shall come out of thy loins;</p>

<p> And the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will<br>
           give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land.</p>

<p> And God went up from him in the place where he talked with<br>
           him.</p>

<p> And Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with<br>
           him, even a pillar of stone: and he poured a drink offering<br>
           thereon, and he poured oil thereon.</p>

<p> And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with<br>
           him, Bethel.</p>

<p> And they journeyed from Bethel; and there was but a little way<br>
           to come to Ephrath: and Rachel travailed, and she had hard<br>
           labour.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, when she was in hard labour, that the<br>
           midwife said unto her, Fear not; thou shalt have this son<br>
           also.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, as her soul was in departing, (for she<br>
           died) that she called his name Benoni: but his father called<br>
           him Benjamin.</p>

<p> And Rachel died, and was buried in the way to Ephrath, which<br>
           is Bethlehem.</p>

<p> And Jacob set a pillar upon her grave: that is the pillar of<br>
           Rachel's grave unto this day.</p>

<p> And Israel journeyed, and spread his tent beyond the tower of<br>
           Edar.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, when Israel dwelt in that land, that<br>
           Reuben went and lay with Bilhah his father's concubine: and<br>
           Israel heard it. Now the sons of Jacob were twelve:</p>

<p> The sons of Leah; Reuben, Jacob's firstborn, and Simeon, and<br>
           Levi, and Judah, and Issachar, and Zebulun:</p>

<p> The sons of Rachel; Joseph, and Benjamin:</p>

<p> And the sons of Bilhah, Rachel's handmaid; Dan, and Naphtali:</p>

<p> And the sons of Zilpah, Leah's handmaid: Gad, and Asher: these<br>
           are the sons of Jacob, which were born to him in Padanaram.</p>

<p> And Jacob came unto Isaac his father unto Mamre, unto the city<br>
           of Arbah, which is Hebron, where Abraham and Isaac sojourned.</p>

<p> And the days of Isaac were an hundred and fourscore years.</p>

<p> And Isaac gave up the ghost, and died, and was gathered unto<br>
           his people, being old and full of days: and his sons Esau and<br>
           Jacob buried him.</p>

<p> Now these are the generations of Esau, who is Edom.</p>

<p> Esau took his wives of the daughters of Canaan; Adah the<br>
           daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Aholibamah the daughter of<br>
           Anah the daughter of Zibeon the Hivite;</p>

<p> And Bashemath Ishmael's daughter, sister of Nebajoth.</p>

<p> And Adah bare to Esau Eliphaz; and Bashemath bare Reuel;</p>

<p> And Aholibamah bare Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah: these are<br>
           the sons of Esau, which were born unto him in the land of<br>
           Canaan.</p>

<p> And Esau took his wives, and his sons, and his daughters, and<br>
           all the persons of his house, and his cattle, and all his<br>
           beasts, and all his substance, which he had got in the land of<br>
           Canaan; and went into the country from the face of his brother<br>
           Jacob.</p>

<p> For their riches were more than that they might dwell<br>
           together; and the land wherein they were strangers could not<br>
           bear them because of their cattle.</p>

<p> Thus dwelt Esau in mount Seir: Esau is Edom.</p>

<p> And these are the generations of Esau the father of the<br>
           Edomites in mount Seir:</p>

<p> These are the names of Esau's sons; Eliphaz the son of Adah<br>
           the wife of Esau, Reuel the son of Bashemath the wife of Esau.</p>

<p> And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, and Gatam,<br>
           and Kenaz.</p>

<p> And Timna was concubine to Eliphaz Esau's son; and she bare to<br>
           Eliphaz Amalek: these were the sons of Adah Esau's wife.</p>

<p> And these are the sons of Reuel; Nahath, and Zerah, Shammah,<br>
           and Mizzah: these were the sons of Bashemath Esau's wife.</p>

<p> And these were the sons of Aholibamah, the daughter of Anah<br>
           the daughter of Zibeon, Esau's wife: and she bare to Esau<br>
           Jeush, and Jaalam, and Korah.</p>

<p> These were dukes of the sons of Esau: the sons of Eliphaz the<br>
           firstborn son of Esau; duke Teman, duke Omar, duke Zepho, duke<br>
           Kenaz,</p>

<p> Duke Korah, duke Gatam, and duke Amalek: these are the dukes<br>
           that came of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; these were the sons<br>
           of Adah.</p>

<p> And these are the sons of Reuel Esau's son; duke Nahath, duke<br>
           Zerah, duke Shammah, duke Mizzah: these are the dukes that<br>
           came of Reuel in the land of Edom; these are the sons of<br>
           Bashemath Esau's wife.</p>

<p> And these are the sons of Aholibamah Esau's wife; duke Jeush,<br>
           duke Jaalam, duke Korah: these were the dukes that came of<br>
           Aholibamah the daughter of Anah, Esau's wife.</p>

<p> These are the sons of Esau, who is Edom, and these are their<br>
           dukes.</p>

<p> These are the sons of Seir the Horite, who inhabited the land;<br>
           Lotan, and Shobal, and Zibeon, and Anah,</p>

<p> And Dishon, and Ezer, and Dishan: these are the dukes of the<br>
           Horites, the children of Seir in the land of Edom.</p>

<p> And the children of Lotan were Hori and Hemam; and Lotan's<br>
           sister was Timna.</p>

<p> And the children of Shobal were these; Alvan, and Manahath,<br>
           and Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.</p>

<p> And these are the children of Zibeon; both Ajah, and Anah:<br>
           this was that Anah that found the mules in the wilderness, as<br>
           he fed the asses of Zibeon his father.</p>

<p> And the children of Anah were these; Dishon, and Aholibamah<br>
           the daughter of Anah.</p>

<p> And these are the children of Dishon; Hemdan, and Eshban, and<br>
           Ithran, and Cheran.</p>

<p> The children of Ezer are these; Bilhan, and Zaavan, and Akan.</p>

<p> The children of Dishan are these; Uz, and Aran.</p>

<p> These are the dukes that came of the Horites; duke Lotan, duke<br>
           Shobal, duke Zibeon, duke Anah,</p>

<p> Duke Dishon, duke Ezer, duke Dishan: these are the dukes that<br>
           came of Hori, among their dukes in the land of Seir.</p>

<p> And these are the kings that reigned in the land of Edom,<br>
           before there reigned any king over the children of Israel.</p>

<p> And Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom: and the name of his<br>
           city was Dinhabah.</p>

<p> And Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned in<br>
           his stead.</p>

<p> And Jobab died, and Husham of the land of Temani reigned in<br>
           his stead.</p>

<p> And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who smote Midian<br>
           in the field of Moab, reigned in his stead: and the name of<br>
           his city was Avith.</p>

<p> And Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah reigned in his stead.</p>

<p> And Samlah died, and Saul of Rehoboth by the river reigned in<br>
           his stead.</p>

<p> And Saul died, and Baalhanan the son of Achbor reigned in his<br>
           stead.</p>

<p> And Baalhanan the son of Achbor died, and Hadar reigned in his<br>
           stead: and the name of his city was Pau; and his wife's name<br>
           was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred, the daughter of<br>
           Mezahab.</p>

<p> And these are the names of the dukes that came of Esau,<br>
           according to their families, after their places, by their<br>
           names; duke Timnah, duke Alvah, duke Jetheth,</p>

<p> Duke Aholibamah, duke Elah, duke Pinon,</p>

<p> Duke Kenaz, duke Teman, duke Mibzar,</p>

<p> Duke Magdiel, duke Iram: these be the dukes of Edom, according<br>
           to their habitations in the land of their possession: he is<br>
           Esau the father of the Edomites.</p>

<p> And Jacob dwelt in the land wherein his father was a stranger,<br>
           in the land of Canaan.</p>

<p> These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph, being seventeen<br>
           years old, was feeding the flock with his brethren; and the<br>
           lad was with the sons of Bilhah, and with the sons of Zilpah,<br>
           his father's wives: and Joseph brought unto his father their<br>
           evil report.</p>

<p> Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he<br>
           was the son of his old age: and he made him a coat of many<br>
           colours.</p>

<p> And when his brethren saw that their father loved him more<br>
           than all his brethren, they hated him, and could not speak<br>
           peaceably unto him.</p>

<p> And Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it his brethren: and<br>
           they hated him yet the more.</p>

<p> And he said unto them, Hear, I pray you, this dream which I<br>
           have dreamed:</p>

<p> For, behold, we were binding sheaves in the field, and, lo, my<br>
           sheaf arose, and also stood upright; and, behold, your sheaves<br>
           stood round about, and made obeisance to my sheaf.</p>

<p> And his brethren said to him, Shalt thou indeed reign over us?<br>
           or shalt thou indeed have dominion over us? And they hated him<br>
           yet the more for his dreams, and for his words.</p>

<p> And he dreamed yet another dream, and told it his brethren,<br>
           and said, Behold, I have dreamed a dream more; and, behold,<br>
           the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to<br>
           me.</p>

<p> And he told it to his father, and to his brethren: and his<br>
           father rebuked him, and said unto him, What is this dream that<br>
           thou hast dreamed? Shall I and thy mother and thy brethren<br>
           indeed come to bow down ourselves to thee to the earth?</p>

<p> And his brethren envied him; but his father observed the<br>
           saying.</p>

<p> And his brethren went to feed their father's flock in Shechem.</p>

<p> And Israel said unto Joseph, Do not thy brethren feed the<br>
           flock in Shechem? come, and I will send thee unto them. And he<br>
           said to him, Here am I.</p>

<p> And he said to him, Go, I pray thee, see whether it be well<br>
           with thy brethren, and well with the flocks; and bring me word<br>
           again. So he sent him out of the vale of Hebron, and he came<br>
           to Shechem.</p>

<p> And a certain man found him, and, behold, he was wandering in<br>
           the field: and the man asked him, saying, What seekest thou?</p>

<p> And he said, I seek my brethren: tell me, I pray thee, where<br>
           they feed their flocks.</p>

<p> And the man said, They are departed hence; for I heard them<br>
           say, Let us go to Dothan. And Joseph went after his brethren,<br>
           and found them in Dothan.</p>

<p> And when they saw him afar off, even before he came near unto<br>
           them, they conspired against him to slay him.</p>

<p> And they said one to another, Behold, this dreamer cometh.</p>

<p> Come now therefore, and let us slay him, and cast him into<br>
           some pit, and we will say, Some evil beast hath devoured him:<br>
           and we shall see what will become of his dreams.</p>

<p> And Reuben heard it, and he delivered him out of their hands;<br>
           and said, Let us not kill him.</p>

<p> And Reuben said unto them, Shed no blood, but cast him into<br>
           this pit that is in the wilderness, and lay no hand upon him;<br>
           that he might rid him out of their hands, to deliver him to<br>
           his father again.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, when Joseph was come unto his brethren,<br>
           that they stript Joseph out of his coat, his coat of many<br>
           colours that was on him;</p>

<p> And they took him, and cast him into a pit: and the pit was<br>
           empty, there was no water in it.</p>

<p> And they sat down to eat bread: and they lifted up their eyes<br>
           and looked, and, behold, a company of Ishmeelites came from<br>
           Gilead with their camels bearing spicery and balm and myrrh,<br>
           going to carry it down to Egypt.</p>

<p> And Judah said unto his brethren, What profit is it if we slay<br>
           our brother, and conceal his blood?</p>

<p> Come, and let us sell him to the Ishmeelites, and let not our<br>
           hand be upon him; for he is our brother and our flesh. And his<br>
           brethren were content.</p>

<p> Then there passed by Midianites merchantmen; and they drew and<br>
           lifted up Joseph out of the pit, and sold Joseph to the<br>
           Ishmeelites for twenty pieces of silver: and they brought<br>
           Joseph into Egypt.</p>

<p> And Reuben returned unto the pit; and, behold, Joseph was not<br>
           in the pit; and he rent his clothes.</p>

<p> And he returned unto his brethren, and said, The child is not;<br>
           and I, whither shall I go?</p>

<p> And they took Joseph's coat, and killed a kid of the goats,<br>
           and dipped the coat in the blood;</p>

<p> And they sent the coat of many colours, and they brought it to<br>
           their father; and said, This have we found: know now whether<br>
           it be thy son's coat or no.</p>

<p> And he knew it, and said, It is my son's coat; an evil beast<br>
           hath devoured him; Joseph is without doubt rent in pieces.</p>

<p> And Jacob rent his clothes, and put sackcloth upon his loins,<br>
           and mourned for his son many days.</p>

<p> And all his sons and all his daughters rose up to comfort him;<br>
           but he refused to be comforted; and he said, For I will go<br>
           down into the grave unto my son mourning. Thus his father wept<br>
           for him.</p>

<p> And the Midianites sold him into Egypt unto Potiphar, an<br>
           officer of Pharaoh's, and captain of the guard.</p>

<p> And it came to pass at that time, that Judah went down from<br>
           his brethren, and turned in to a certain Adullamite, whose<br>
           name was Hirah.</p>

<p> And Judah saw there a daughter of a certain Canaanite, whose<br>
           name was Shuah; and he took her, and went in unto her.</p>

<p> And she conceived, and bare a son; and he called his name Er.</p>

<p> And she conceived again, and bare a son; and she called his<br>
           name Onan.</p>

<p> And she yet again conceived, and bare a son; and called his<br>
           name Shelah: and he was at Chezib, when she bare him.</p>

<p> And Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn, whose name was<br>
           Tamar.</p>

<p> And Er, Judah's firstborn, was wicked in the sight of the<br>
           LORD; and the LORD slew him.</p>

<p> And Judah said unto Onan, Go in unto thy brother's wife, and<br>
           marry her, and raise up seed to thy brother.</p>

<p> And Onan knew that the seed should not be his; and it came to<br>
           pass, when he went in unto his brother's wife, that he spilled<br>
           it on the ground, lest that he should give seed to his<br>
           brother.</p>

<p> And the thing which he did displeased the LORD: wherefore he<br>
           slew him also.</p>

<p> Then said Judah to Tamar his daughter in law, Remain a widow<br>
           at thy father's house, till Shelah my son be grown: for he<br>
           said, Lest peradventure he die also, as his brethren did. And<br>
           Tamar went and dwelt in her father's house.</p>

<p> And in process of time the daughter of Shuah Judah's wife<br>
           died; and Judah was comforted, and went up unto his<br>
           sheepshearers to Timnath, he and his friend Hirah the<br>
           Adullamite.</p>

<p> And it was told Tamar, saying, Behold thy father in law goeth<br>
           up to Timnath to shear his sheep.</p>

<p> And she put her widow's garments off from her, and covered her<br>
           with a vail, and wrapped herself, and sat in an open place,<br>
           which is by the way to Timnath; for she saw that Shelah was<br>
           grown, and she was not given unto him to wife.</p>

<p> When Judah saw her, he thought her to be an harlot; because<br>
           she had covered her face.</p>

<p> And he turned unto her by the way, and said, Go to, I pray<br>
           thee, let me come in unto thee; (for he knew not that she was<br>
           his daughter in law.) And she said, What wilt thou give me,<br>
           that thou mayest come in unto me?</p>

<p> And he said, I will send thee a kid from the flock. And she<br>
           said, Wilt thou give me a pledge, till thou send it?</p>

<p> And he said, What pledge shall I give thee? And she said, Thy<br>
           signet, and thy bracelets, and thy staff that is in thine<br>
           hand. And he gave it her, and came in unto her, and she<br>
           conceived by him.</p>

<p> And she arose, and went away, and laid by her vail from her,<br>
           and put on the garments of her widowhood.</p>

<p> And Judah sent the kid by the hand of his friend the<br>
           Adullamite, to receive his pledge from the woman's hand: but<br>
           he found her not.</p>

<p> Then he asked the men of that place, saying, Where is the<br>
           harlot, that was openly by the way side? And they said, There<br>
           was no harlot in this place.</p>

<p> And he returned to Judah, and said, I cannot find her; and<br>
           also the men of the place said, that there was no harlot in<br>
           this place.</p>

<p> And Judah said, Let her take it to her, lest we be shamed:<br>
           behold, I sent this kid, and thou hast not found her.</p>

<p> And it came to pass about three months after, that it was told<br>
           Judah, saying, Tamar thy daughter in law hath played the<br>
           harlot; and also, behold, she is with child by whoredom. And<br>
           Judah said, Bring her forth, and let her be burnt.</p>

<p> When she was brought forth, she sent to her father in law,<br>
           saying, By the man, whose these are, am I with child: and she<br>
           said, Discern, I pray thee, whose are these, the signet, and<br>
           bracelets, and staff.</p>

<p> And Judah acknowledged them, and said, She hath been more<br>
           righteous than I; because that I gave her not to Shelah my<br>
           son. And he knew her again no more.</p>

<p> And it came to pass in the time of her travail, that, behold,<br>
           twins were in her womb.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, when she travailed, that the one put out<br>
           his hand: and the midwife took and bound upon his hand a<br>
           scarlet thread, saying, This came out first.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, as he drew back his hand, that, behold,<br>
           his brother came out: and she said, How hast thou broken<br>
           forth? this breach be upon thee: therefore his name was called<br>
           Pharez.</p>

<p> And afterward came out his brother, that had the scarlet<br>
           thread upon his hand: and his name was called Zarah.</p>

<p> And Joseph was brought down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an officer<br>
           of Pharaoh, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, bought him of<br>
           the hands of the Ishmeelites, which had brought him down<br>
           thither.</p>

<p> And the LORD was with Joseph, and he was a prosperous man; and<br>
           he was in the house of his master the Egyptian.</p>

<p> And his master saw that the LORD was with him, and that the<br>
           LORD made all that he did to prosper in his hand.</p>

<p> And Joseph found grace in his sight, and he served him: and he<br>
           made him overseer over his house, and all that he had he put<br>
           into his hand.</p>

<p> And it came to pass from the time that he had made him<br>
           overseer in his house, and over all that he had, that the LORD<br>
           blessed the Egyptian's house for Joseph's sake; and the<br>
           blessing of the LORD was upon all that he had in the house,<br>
           and in the field.</p>

<p> And he left all that he had in Joseph's hand; and he knew not<br>
           ought he had, save the bread which he did eat. And Joseph was<br>
           a goodly person, and well favoured.</p>

<p> And it came to pass after these things, that his master's wife<br>
           cast her eyes upon Joseph; and she said, Lie with me.</p>

<p> But he refused, and said unto his master's wife, Behold, my<br>
           master wotteth not what is with me in the house, and he hath<br>
           committed all that he hath to my hand;</p>

<p> There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he<br>
           kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his<br>
           wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against<br>
           God?</p>

<p> And it came to pass, as she spake to Joseph day by day, that<br>
           he hearkened not unto her, to lie by her, or to be with her.</p>

<p> And it came to pass about this time, that Joseph went into the<br>
           house to do his business; and there was none of the men of the<br>
           house there within.</p>

<p> And she caught him by his garment, saying, Lie with me: and he<br>
           left his garment in her hand, and fled, and got him out.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, when she saw that he had left his garment<br>
           in her hand, and was fled forth,</p>

<p> That she called unto the men of her house, and spake unto<br>
           them, saying, See, he hath brought in an Hebrew unto us to<br>
           mock us; he came in unto me to lie with me, and I cried with a<br>
           loud voice:</p>

<p> And it came to pass, when he heard that I lifted up my voice<br>
           and cried, that he left his garment with me, and fled, and got<br>
           him out.</p>

<p> And she laid up his garment by her, until his lord came home.</p>

<p> And she spake unto him according to these words, saying, The<br>
           Hebrew servant, which thou hast brought unto us, came in unto<br>
           me to mock me:</p>

<p> And it came to pass, as I lifted up my voice and cried, that<br>
           he left his garment with me, and fled out.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, when his master heard the words of his<br>
           wife, which she spake unto him, saying, After this manner did<br>
           thy servant to me; that his wrath was kindled.</p>

<p> And Joseph's master took him, and put him into the prison, a<br>
           place where the king's prisoners were bound: and he was there<br>
           in the prison.</p>

<p> But the LORD was with Joseph, and shewed him mercy, and gave<br>
           him favour in the sight of the keeper of the prison.</p>

<p> And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph's hand all<br>
           the prisoners that were in the prison; and whatsoever they did<br>
           there, he was the doer of it.</p>

<p> The keeper of the prison looked not to any thing that was<br>
           under his hand; because the LORD was with him, and that which<br>
           he did, the LORD made it to prosper.</p>

<p> And it came to pass after these things, that the butler of the<br>
           king of Egypt and his baker had offended their lord the king<br>
           of Egypt.</p>

<p> And Pharaoh was wroth against two of his officers, against the<br>
           chief of the butlers, and against the chief of the bakers.</p>

<p> And he put them in ward in the house of the captain of the<br>
           guard, into the prison, the place where Joseph was bound.</p>

<p> And the captain of the guard charged Joseph with them, and he<br>
           served them: and they continued a season in ward.</p>

<p> And they dreamed a dream both of them, each man his dream in<br>
           one night, each man according to the interpretation of his<br>
           dream, the butler and the baker of the king of Egypt, which<br>
           were bound in the prison.</p>

<p> And Joseph came in unto them in the morning, and looked upon<br>
           them, and, behold, they were sad.</p>

<p> And he asked Pharaoh's officers that were with him in the ward<br>
           of his lord's house, saying, Wherefore look ye so sadly to<br>
           day?</p>

<p> And they said unto him, We have dreamed a dream, and there is<br>
           no interpreter of it. And Joseph said unto them, Do not<br>
           interpretations belong to God? tell me them, I pray you.</p>

<p> And the chief butler told his dream to Joseph, and said to<br>
           him, In my dream, behold, a vine was before me;</p>

<p> And in the vine were three branches: and it was as though it<br>
           budded, and her blossoms shot forth; and the clusters thereof<br>
           brought forth ripe grapes:</p>

<p> And Pharaoh's cup was in my hand: and I took the grapes, and<br>
           pressed them into Pharaoh's cup, and I gave the cup into<br>
           Pharaoh's hand.</p>

<p> And Joseph said unto him, This is the interpretation of it:<br>
           The three branches are three days:</p>

<p> Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thine head, and<br>
           restore thee unto thy place: and thou shalt deliver Pharaoh's<br>
           cup into his hand, after the former manner when thou wast his<br>
           butler.</p>

<p> But think on me when it shall be well with thee, and shew<br>
           kindness, I pray thee, unto me, and make mention of me unto<br>
           Pharaoh, and bring me out of this house:</p>

<p> For indeed I was stolen away out of the land of the Hebrews:<br>
           and here also have I done nothing that they should put me into<br>
           the dungeon.</p>

<p> When the chief baker saw that the interpretation was good, he<br>
           said unto Joseph, I also was in my dream, and, behold, I had<br>
           three white baskets on my head:</p>

<p> And in the uppermost basket there was of all manner of<br>
           bakemeats for Pharaoh; and the birds did eat them out of the<br>
           basket upon my head.</p>

<p> And Joseph answered and said, This is the interpretation<br>
           thereof: The three baskets are three days:</p>

<p> Yet within three days shall Pharaoh lift up thy head from off<br>
           thee, and shall hang thee on a tree; and the birds shall eat<br>
           thy flesh from off thee.</p>

<p> And it came to pass the third day, which was Pharaoh's<br>
           birthday, that he made a feast unto all his servants: and he<br>
           lifted up the head of the chief butler and of the chief baker<br>
           among his servants.</p>

<p> And he restored the chief butler unto his butlership again;<br>
           and he gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand:</p>

<p> But he hanged the chief baker: as Joseph had interpreted to<br>
           them.</p>

<p> Yet did not the chief butler remember Joseph, but forgat him.</p>

<p> And it came to pass at the end of two full years, that Pharaoh<br>
           dreamed: and, behold, he stood by the river.</p>

<p> And, behold, there came up out of the river seven well<br>
           favoured kine and fatfleshed; and they fed in a meadow.</p>

<p> And, behold, seven other kine came up after them out of the<br>
           river, ill favoured and leanfleshed; and stood by the other<br>
           kine upon the brink of the river.</p>

<p> And the ill favoured and leanfleshed kine did eat up the seven<br>
           well favoured and fat kine. So Pharaoh awoke.</p>

<p> And he slept and dreamed the second time: and, behold, seven<br>
           ears of corn came up upon one stalk, rank and good.</p>

<p> And, behold, seven thin ears and blasted with the east wind<br>
           sprung up after them.</p>

<p> And the seven thin ears devoured the seven rank and full ears.<br>
           And Pharaoh awoke, and, behold, it was a dream.</p>

<p> And it came to pass in the morning that his spirit was<br>
           troubled; and he sent and called for all the magicians of<br>
           Egypt, and all the wise men thereof: and Pharaoh told them his<br>
           dream; but there was none that could interpret them unto<br>
           Pharaoh.</p>

<p> Then spake the chief butler unto Pharaoh, saying, I do<br>
           remember my faults this day:</p>

<p> Pharaoh was wroth with his servants, and put me in ward in the<br>
           captain of the guard's house, both me and the chief baker:</p>

<p> And we dreamed a dream in one night, I and he; we dreamed each<br>
           man according to the interpretation of his dream.</p>

<p> And there was there with us a young man, an Hebrew, servant to<br>
           the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted<br>
           to us our dreams; to each man according to his dream he did<br>
           interpret.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, as he interpreted to us, so it was; me he<br>
           restored unto mine office, and him he hanged.</p>

<p> Then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph, and they brought him<br>
           hastily out of the dungeon: and he shaved himself, and changed<br>
           his raiment, and came in unto Pharaoh.</p>

<p> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I have dreamed a dream, and<br>
           there is none that can interpret it: and I have heard say of<br>
           thee, that thou canst understand a dream to interpret it.</p>

<p> And Joseph answered Pharaoh, saying, It is not in me: God<br>
           shall give Pharaoh an answer of peace.</p>

<p> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, In my dream, behold, I stood<br>
           upon the bank of the river:</p>

<p> And, behold, there came up out of the river seven kine,<br>
           fatfleshed and well favoured; and they fed in a meadow:</p>

<p> And, behold, seven other kine came up after them, poor and<br>
           very ill favoured and leanfleshed, such as I never saw in all<br>
           the land of Egypt for badness:</p>

<p> And the lean and the ill favoured kine did eat up the first<br>
           seven fat kine:</p>

<p> And when they had eaten them up, it could not be known that<br>
           they had eaten them; but they were still ill favoured, as at<br>
           the beginning. So I awoke.</p>

<p> And I saw in my dream, and, behold, seven ears came up in one<br>
           stalk, full and good:</p>

<p> And, behold, seven ears, withered, thin, and blasted with the<br>
           east wind, sprung up after them:</p>

<p> And the thin ears devoured the seven good ears: and I told<br>
           this unto the magicians; but there was none that could declare<br>
           it to me.</p>

<p> And Joseph said unto Pharaoh, The dream of Pharaoh is one: God<br>
           hath shewed Pharaoh what he is about to do.</p>

<p> The seven good kine are seven years; and the seven good ears<br>
           are seven years: the dream is one.</p>

<p> And the seven thin and ill favoured kine that came up after<br>
           them are seven years; and the seven empty ears blasted with<br>
           the east wind shall be seven years of famine.</p>

<p> This is the thing which I have spoken unto Pharaoh: What God<br>
           is about to do he sheweth unto Pharaoh.</p>

<p> Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all<br>
           the land of Egypt:</p>

<p> And there shall arise after them seven years of famine; and<br>
           all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt; and<br>
           the famine shall consume the land;</p>

<p> And the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of<br>
           that famine following; for it shall be very grievous.</p>

<p> And for that the dream was doubled unto Pharaoh twice; it is<br>
           because the thing is established by God, and God will shortly<br>
           bring it to pass.</p>

<p> Now therefore let Pharaoh look out a man discreet and wise,<br>
           and set him over the land of Egypt.</p>

<p> Let Pharaoh do this, and let him appoint officers over the<br>
           land, and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the<br>
           seven plenteous years.</p>

<p> And let them gather all the food of those good years that<br>
           come, and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh, and let them<br>
           keep food in the cities.</p>

<p> And that food shall be for store to the land against the seven<br>
           years of famine, which shall be in the land of Egypt; that the<br>
           land perish not through the famine.</p>

<p> And the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh, and in the eyes<br>
           of all his servants.</p>

<p> And Pharaoh said unto his servants, Can we find such a one as<br>
           this is, a man in whom the Spirit of God is?</p>

<p> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Forasmuch as God hath shewed<br>
           thee all this, there is none so discreet and wise as thou art:</p>

<p> Thou shalt be over my house, and according unto thy word shall<br>
           all my people be ruled: only in the throne will I be greater<br>
           than thou.</p>

<p> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, See, I have set thee over all<br>
           the land of Egypt.</p>

<p> And Pharaoh took off his ring from his hand, and put it upon<br>
           Joseph's hand, and arrayed him in vestures of fine linen, and<br>
           put a gold chain about his neck;</p>

<p> And he made him to ride in the second chariot which he had;<br>
           and they cried before him, Bow the knee: and he made him ruler<br>
           over all the land of Egypt.</p>

<p> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, I am Pharaoh, and without thee<br>
           shall no man lift up his hand or foot in all the land of<br>
           Egypt.</p>

<p> And Pharaoh called Joseph's name Zaphnathpaaneah; and he gave<br>
           him to wife Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On.<br>
           And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt.</p>

<p> And Joseph was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh<br>
           king of Egypt. And Joseph went out from the presence of<br>
           Pharaoh, and went throughout all the land of Egypt.</p>

<p> And in the seven plenteous years the earth brought forth by<br>
           handfuls.</p>

<p> And he gathered up all the food of the seven years, which were<br>
           in the land of Egypt, and laid up the food in the cities: the<br>
           food of the field, which was round about every city, laid he<br>
           up in the same.</p>

<p> And Joseph gathered corn as the sand of the sea, very much,<br>
           until he left numbering; for it was without number.</p>

<p> And unto Joseph were born two sons before the years of famine<br>
           came, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On<br>
           bare unto him.</p>

<p> And Joseph called the name of the firstborn Manasseh: For God,<br>
           said he, hath made me forget all my toil, and all my father's<br>
           house.</p>

<p> And the name of the second called he Ephraim: For God hath<br>
           caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction.</p>

<p> And the seven years of plenteousness, that was in the land of<br>
           Egypt, were ended.</p>

<p> And the seven years of dearth began to come, according as<br>
           Joseph had said: and the dearth was in all lands; but in all<br>
           the land of Egypt there was bread.</p>

<p> And when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried<br>
           to Pharaoh for bread: and Pharaoh said unto all the Egyptians,<br>
           Go unto Joseph; what he saith to you, do.</p>

<p> And the famine was over all the face of the earth: and Joseph<br>
           opened all the storehouses, and sold unto the Egyptians; and<br>
           the famine waxed sore in the land of Egypt.</p>

<p> And all countries came into Egypt to Joseph for to buy corn;<br>
           because that the famine was so sore in all lands.</p>

<p> Now when Jacob saw that there was corn in Egypt, Jacob said<br>
           unto his sons, Why do ye look one upon another?</p>

<p> And he said, Behold, I have heard that there is corn in Egypt:<br>
           get you down thither, and buy for us from thence; that we may<br>
           live, and not die.</p>

<p> And Joseph's ten brethren went down to buy corn in Egypt.</p>

<p> But Benjamin, Joseph's brother, Jacob sent not with his<br>
           brethren; for he said, Lest peradventure mischief befall him.</p>

<p> And the sons of Israel came to buy corn among those that came:<br>
           for the famine was in the land of Canaan.</p>

<p> And Joseph was the governor over the land, and he it was that<br>
           sold to all the people of the land: and Joseph's brethren<br>
           came, and bowed down themselves before him with their faces to<br>
           the earth.</p>

<p> And Joseph saw his brethren, and he knew them, but made<br>
           himself strange unto them, and spake roughly unto them; and he<br>
           said unto them, Whence come ye? And they said, From the land<br>
           of Canaan to buy food.</p>

<p> And Joseph knew his brethren, but they knew not him.</p>

<p> And Joseph remembered the dreams which he dreamed of them, and<br>
           said unto them, Ye are spies; to see the nakedness of the land<br>
           ye are come.</p>

<p> And they said unto him, Nay, my lord, but to buy food are thy<br>
           servants come.</p>

<p> We are all one man's sons; we are true men, thy servants are<br>
           no spies.</p>

<p> And he said unto them, Nay, but to see the nakedness of the<br>
           land ye are come.</p>

<p> And they said, Thy servants are twelve brethren, the sons of<br>
           one man in the land of Canaan; and, behold, the youngest is<br>
           this day with our father, and one is not.</p>

<p> And Joseph said unto them, That is it that I spake unto you,<br>
           saying, Ye are spies:</p>

<p> Hereby ye shall be proved: By the life of Pharaoh ye shall not<br>
           go forth hence, except your youngest brother come hither.</p>

<p> Send one of you, and let him fetch your brother, and ye shall<br>
           be kept in prison, that your words may be proved, whether<br>
           there be any truth in you: or else by the life of Pharaoh<br>
           surely ye are spies.</p>

<p> And he put them all together into ward three days.</p>

<p> And Joseph said unto them the third day, This do, and live;<br>
           for I fear God:</p>

<p> If ye be true men, let one of your brethren be bound in the<br>
           house of your prison: go ye, carry corn for the famine of your<br>
           houses:</p>

<p> But bring your youngest brother unto me; so shall your words<br>
           be verified, and ye shall not die. And they did so.</p>

<p> And they said one to another, We are verily guilty concerning<br>
           our brother, in that we saw the anguish of his soul, when he<br>
           besought us, and we would not hear; therefore is this distress<br>
           come upon us.</p>

<p> And Reuben answered them, saying, Spake I not unto you,<br>
           saying, Do not sin against the child; and ye would not hear?<br>
           therefore, behold, also his blood is required.</p>

<p> And they knew not that Joseph understood them; for he spake<br>
           unto them by an interpreter.</p>

<p> And he turned himself about from them, and wept; and returned<br>
           to them again, and communed with them, and took from them<br>
           Simeon, and bound him before their eyes.</p>

<p> Then Joseph commanded to fill their sacks with corn, and to<br>
           restore every man's money into his sack, and to give them<br>
           provision for the way: and thus did he unto them.</p>

<p> And they laded their asses with the corn, and departed thence.</p>

<p> And as one of them opened his sack to give his ass provender<br>
           in the inn, he espied his money; for, behold, it was in his<br>
           sack's mouth.</p>

<p> And he said unto his brethren, My money is restored; and, lo,<br>
           it is even in my sack: and their heart failed them, and they<br>
           were afraid, saying one to another, What is this that God hath<br>
           done unto us?</p>

<p> And they came unto Jacob their father unto the land of Canaan,<br>
           and told him all that befell unto them; saying,</p>

<p> The man, who is the lord of the land, spake roughly to us, and<br>
           took us for spies of the country.</p>

<p> And we said unto him, We are true men; we are no spies:</p>

<p> We be twelve brethren, sons of our father; one is not, and the<br>
           youngest is this day with our father in the land of Canaan.</p>

<p> And the man, the lord of the country, said unto us, Hereby<br>
           shall I know that ye are true men; leave one of your brethren<br>
           here with me, and take food for the famine of your households,<br>
           and be gone:</p>

<p> And bring your youngest brother unto me: then shall I know<br>
           that ye are no spies, but that ye are true men: so will I<br>
           deliver you your brother, and ye shall traffick in the land.</p>

<p> And it came to pass as they emptied their sacks, that, behold,<br>
           every man's bundle of money was in his sack: and when both<br>
           they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were<br>
           afraid.</p>

<p> And Jacob their father said unto them, Me have ye bereaved of<br>
           my children: Joseph is not, and Simeon is not, and ye will<br>
           take Benjamin away: all these things are against me.</p>

<p> And Reuben spake unto his father, saying, Slay my two sons, if<br>
           I bring him not to thee: deliver him into my hand, and I will<br>
           bring him to thee again.</p>

<p> And he said, My son shall not go down with you; for his<br>
           brother is dead, and he is left alone: if mischief befall him<br>
           by the way in the which ye go, then shall ye bring down my<br>
           gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</p>

<p> And the famine was sore in the land.</p>

<p> And it came to pass, when they had eaten up the corn which<br>
           they had brought out of Egypt, their father said unto them, Go<br>
           again, buy us a little food.</p>

<p> And Judah spake unto him, saying, The man did solemnly protest<br>
           unto us, saying, Ye shall not see my face, except your brother<br>
           be with you.</p>

<p> If thou wilt send our brother with us, we will go down and buy<br>
           thee food:</p>

<p> But if thou wilt not send him, we will not go down: for the<br>
           man said unto us, Ye shall not see my face, except your<br>
           brother be with you.</p>

<p> And Israel said, Wherefore dealt ye so ill with me, as to tell<br>
           the man whether ye had yet a brother?</p>

<p> And they said, The man asked us straitly of our state, and of<br>
           our kindred, saying, Is your father yet alive? have ye another<br>
           brother? and we told him according to the tenor of these<br>
           words: could we certainly know that he would say, Bring your<br>
           brother down?</p>

<p> And Judah said unto Israel his father, Send the lad with me,<br>
           and we will arise and go; that we may live, and not die, both<br>
           we, and thou, and also our little ones.</p>

<p> I will be surety for him; of my hand shalt thou require him:<br>
           if I bring him not unto thee, and set him before thee, then<br>
           let me bear the blame for ever:</p>

<p> For except we had lingered, surely now we had returned this<br>
           second time.</p>

<p> And their father Israel said unto them, If it must be so now,<br>
           do this; take of the best fruits in the land in your vessels,<br>
           and carry down the man a present, a little balm, and a little<br>
           honey, spices, and myrrh, nuts, and almonds:</p>

<p> And take double money in your hand; and the money that was<br>
           brought again in the mouth of your sacks, carry it again in<br>
           your hand; peradventure it was an oversight:</p>

<p> Take also your brother, and arise, go again unto the man:</p>

<p> And God Almighty give you mercy before the man, that he may<br>
           send away your other brother, and Benjamin. If I be bereaved<br>
           of my children, I am bereaved.</p>

<p> And the men took that present, and they took double money in<br>
           their hand and Benjamin; and rose up, and went down to Egypt,<br>
           and stood before Joseph.</p>

<p> And when Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the ruler<br>
           of his house, Bring these men home, and slay, and make ready;<br>
           for these men shall dine with me at noon.</p>

<p> And the man did as Joseph bade; and the man brought the men<br>
           into Joseph's house.</p>

<p> And the men were afraid, because they were brought into<br>
           Joseph's house; and they said, Because of the money that was<br>
           returned in our sacks at the first time are we brought in;<br>
           that he may seek occasion against us, and fall upon us, and<br>
           take us for bondmen, and our asses.</p>

<p> And they came near to the steward of Joseph's house, and they<br>
           communed with him at the door of the house,</p>

<p> And said, O sir, we came indeed down at the first time to buy<br>
           food:</p>

<p> And it came to pass, when we came to the inn, that we opened<br>
           our sacks, and, behold, every man's money was in the mouth of<br>
           his sack, our money in full weight: and we have brought it<br>
           again in our hand.</p>

<p> And other money have we brought down in our hands to buy food:<br>
           we cannot tell who put our money in our sacks.</p>

<p> And he said, Peace be to you, fear not: your God, and the God<br>
           of your father, hath given you treasure in your sacks: I had<br>
           your money. And he brought Simeon out unto them.</p>

<p> And the man brought the men into Joseph's house, and gave them<br>
           water, and they washed their feet; and he gave their asses<br>
           provender.</p>

<p> And they made ready the present against Joseph came at noon:<br>
           for they heard that they should eat bread there.</p>

<p> And when Joseph came home, they brought him the present which<br>
           was in their hand into the house, and bowed themselves to him<br>
           to the earth.</p>

<p> And he asked them of their welfare, and said, Is your father<br>
           well, the old man of whom ye spake? Is he yet alive?</p>

<p> And they answered, Thy servant our father is in good health,<br>
           he is yet alive. And they bowed down their heads, and made<br>
           obeisance.</p>

<p> And he lifted up his eyes, and saw his brother Benjamin, his<br>
           mother's son, and said, Is this your younger brother, of whom<br>
           ye spake unto me? And he said, God be gracious unto thee, my<br>
           son.</p>

<p> And Joseph made haste; for his bowels did yearn upon his<br>
           brother: and he sought where to weep; and he entered into his<br>
           chamber, and wept there.</p>

<p> And he washed his face, and went out, and refrained himself,<br>
           and said, Set on bread.</p>

<p> And they set on for him by himself, and for them by<br>
           themselves, and for the Egyptians, which did eat with him, by<br>
           themselves: because the Egyptians might not eat bread with the<br>
           Hebrews; for that is an abomination unto the Egyptians.</p>

<p> And they sat before him, the firstborn according to his<br>
           birthright, and the youngest according to his youth: and the<br>
           men marvelled one at another.</p>

<p> And he took and sent messes unto them from before him: but<br>
           Benjamin's mess was five times so much as any of their's. And<br>
           they drank, and were merry with him.</p>

<p> And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, Fill the<br>
           men's sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put<br>
           every man's money in his sack's mouth.</p>

<p> And put my cup, the silver cup, in the sack's mouth of the<br>
           youngest, and his corn money. And he did according to the word<br>
           that Joseph had spoken.</p>

<p> As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they<br>
           and their asses.</p>

<p> And when they were gone out of the city, and not yet far off,<br>
           Joseph said unto his steward, Up, follow after the men; and<br>
           when thou dost overtake them, say unto them, Wherefore have ye<br>
           rewarded evil for good?</p>

<p> Is not this it in which my lord drinketh, and whereby indeed<br>
           he divineth? ye have done evil in so doing.</p>

<p> And he overtook them, and he spake unto them these same words.</p>

<p> And they said unto him, Wherefore saith my lord these words?<br>
           God forbid that thy servants should do according to this<br>
           thing:</p>

<p> Behold, the money, which we found in our sacks' mouths, we<br>
           brought again unto thee out of the land of Canaan: how then<br>
           should we steal out of thy lord's house silver or gold?</p>

<p> With whomsoever of thy servants it be found, both let him die,<br>
           and we also will be my lord's bondmen.</p>

<p> And he said, Now also let it be according unto your words: he<br>
           with whom it is found shall be my servant; and ye shall be<br>
           blameless.</p>

<p> Then they speedily took down every man his sack to the ground,<br>
           and opened every man his sack.</p>

<p> And he searched, and began at the eldest, and left at the<br>
           youngest: and the cup was found in Benjamin's sack.</p>

<p> Then they rent their clothes, and laded every man his ass, and<br>
           returned to the city.</p>

<p> And Judah and his brethren came to Joseph's house; for he was<br>
           yet there: and they fell before him on the ground.</p>

<p> And Joseph said unto them, What deed is this that ye have<br>
           done? wot ye not that such a man as I can certainly divine?</p>

<p> And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what shall we<br>
           speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the<br>
           iniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord's servants,<br>
           both we, and he also with whom the cup is found.</p>

<p> And he said, God forbid that I should do so: but the man in<br>
           whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my servant; and as<br>
           for you, get you up in peace unto your father.</p>

<p> Then Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy<br>
           servant, I pray thee, speak a word in my lord's ears, and let<br>
           not thine anger burn against thy servant: for thou art even as<br>
           Pharaoh.</p>

<p> My lord asked his servants, saying, Have ye a father, or a<br>
           brother?</p>

<p> And we said unto my lord, We have a father, an old man, and a<br>
           child of his old age, a little one; and his brother is dead,<br>
           and he alone is left of his mother, and his father loveth him.</p>

<p> And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him down unto me,<br>
           that I may set mine eyes upon him.</p>

<p> And we said unto my lord, The lad cannot leave his father: for<br>
           if he should leave his father, his father would die.</p>

<p> And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except your youngest<br>
           brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.</p>

<p> And it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my<br>
           father, we told him the words of my lord.</p>

<p> And our father said, Go again, and buy us a little food.</p>

<p> And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be<br>
           with us, then will we go down: for we may not see the man's<br>
           face, except our youngest brother be with us.</p>

<p> And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye know that my wife<br>
           bare me two sons:</p>

<p> And the one went out from me, and I said, Surely he is torn in<br>
           pieces; and I saw him not since:</p>

<p> And if ye take this also from me, and mischief befall him, ye<br>
           shall bring down my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave.</p>

<p> Now therefore when I come to thy servant my father, and the<br>
           lad be not with us; seeing that his life is bound up in the<br>
           lad's life;</p>

<p> It shall come to pass, when he seeth that the lad is not with<br>
           us, that he will die: and thy servants shall bring down the<br>
           gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the grave.</p>

<p> For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father,<br>
           saying, If I bring him not unto thee, then I shall bear the<br>
           blame to my father for ever.</p>

<p> Now therefore, I pray thee, let thy servant abide instead of<br>
           the lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his<br>
           brethren.</p>

<p> For how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with<br>
           me? lest peradventure I see the evil that shall come on my<br>
           father.</p>

<p> Then Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that<br>
           stood by him; and he cried, Cause every man to go out from me.<br>
           And there stood no man with him, while Joseph made himself<br>
           known unto his brethren.</p>

<p> And he wept aloud: and the Egyptians and the house of Pharaoh<br>
           heard.</p>

<p> And Joseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father<br>
           yet live? And his brethren could not answer him; for they were<br>
           troubled at his presence.</p>

<p> And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray<br>
           you. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your<br>
           brother, whom ye sold into Egypt.</p>

<p> Now therefore be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that<br>
           ye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve<br>
           life.</p>

<p> For these two years hath the famine been in the land: and yet<br>
           there are five years, in the which there shall neither be<br>
           earing nor harvest.</p>

<p> And God sent me before you to preserve you a posterity in the<br>
           earth, and to save your lives by a great deliverance.</p>

<p> So now it was not you that sent me hither, but God: and he<br>
           hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of all his house,<br>
           and a ruler throughout all the land of Egypt.</p>

<p> Haste ye, and go up to my father, and say unto him, Thus saith<br>
           thy son Joseph, God hath made me lord of all Egypt: come down<br>
           unto me, tarry not:</p>

<p> And thou shalt dwell in the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be<br>
           near unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's<br>
           children, and thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou<br>
           hast:</p>

<p> And there will I nourish thee; for yet there are five years of<br>
           famine; lest thou, and thy household, and all that thou hast,<br>
           come to poverty.</p>

<p> And, behold, your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother<br>
           Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.</p>

<p> And ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of<br>
           all that ye have seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my<br>
           father hither.</p>

<p> And he fell upon his brother Benjamin's neck, and wept; and<br>
           Benjamin wept upon his neck.</p>

<p> Moreover he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them: and<br>
           after that his brethren talked with him.</p>

<p> And the fame thereof was heard in Pharaoh's house, saying,<br>
           Joseph's brethren are come: and it pleased Pharaoh well, and<br>
           his servants.</p>

<p> And Pharaoh said unto Joseph, Say unto thy brethren, This do<br>
           ye; lade your beasts, and go, get you unto the land of Canaan;</p>

<p> And take your father and your households, and come unto me:<br>
           and I will give you the good of the land of Egypt, and ye<br>
           shall eat the fat of the land.</p>

<p> Now thou art commanded, this do ye; take you wagons out of the<br>
           land of Egypt for your little ones, and for your wives, and<br>
           bring your father, and come.</p>

<p> Also regard not your stuff; for the good of all the land of<br>
           Egypt is your's.</p>

<p> And the children of Israel did so: and Joseph gave them<br>
           wagons, according to the commandment of Pharaoh, and gave them<br>
           provision for the way.</p>

<p> To all of them he gave each man changes of raiment; but to<br>
           Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver, and five<br>
           changes of raiment.</p>

<p> And to his father he sent after this manner; ten asses laden<br>
           with the good things of Egypt, and ten she asses laden with<br>
           corn and bread and meat for his father by the way.</p>

<p> So he sent his brethren away, and they departed: and he said<br>
           unto them, See that ye fall not out by the way.</p>

<p> And they went up out of Egypt, and came into the land of<br>
           Canaan unto Jacob their father,</p>

<p> And told him, saying, Joseph is yet alive, and he is governor<br>
           over all the land of Egypt. And Jacob's heart fainted, for he<br>
           believed them not.</p>

<p> And they told him all the words of Joseph, which he had said<br>
           unto them: and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to<br>
           carry him, the spirit of Jacob their father revived:</p>

<p> And Israel said, It is enough; Joseph my son is yet alive: I<br>
           will go and see him before I die.</p>

<p> And Israel took his journey with all that he had, and came to<br>
           Beersheba, and offered sacrifices unto the God of his father<br>
           Isaac.</p>

<p> And God spake unto Israel in the visions of the night, and<br>
           said, Jacob, Jacob. And he said, Here am I.</p>

<p> And he said, I am God, the God of thy father: fear not to go<br>
           down into Egypt; for I will there make of thee a great nation:</p>

<p> I will go down with thee into Egypt; and I will also surely<br>
           bring thee up again: and Joseph shall put his hand upon thine<br>
           eyes.</p>

<p> And Jacob rose up from Beersheba: and the sons of Israel<br>
           carried Jacob their father, and their little ones, and their<br>
           wives, in the wagons which Pharaoh had sent to carry him.</p>

<p> And they took their cattle, and their goods, which they had<br>
           gotten in the land of Canaan, and came into Egypt, Jacob, and<br>
           all his seed with him:</p>

<p> His sons, and his sons' sons with him, his daughters, and his<br>
           sons' daughters, and all his seed brought he with him into<br>
           Egypt.</p>

<p> And these are the names of the children of Israel, which came<br>
           into Egypt, Jacob and his sons: Reuben, Jacob's firstborn.</p>

<p> And the sons of Reuben; Hanoch, and Phallu, and Hezron, and<br>
           Carmi.</p>

<p> And the sons of Simeon; Jemuel, and Jamin, and Ohad, and<br>
           Jachin, and Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanitish woman.</p>

<p> And the sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.</p>

<p> And the sons of Judah; Er, and Onan, and Shelah, and Pharez,<br>
           and Zarah: but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the<br>
           sons of Pharez were Hezron and Hamul.</p>

<p> And the sons of Issachar; Tola, and Phuvah, and Job, and<br>
           Shimron.</p>

<p> And the sons of Zebulun; Sered, and Elon, and Jahleel.</p>

<p> These be the sons of Leah, which she bare unto Jacob in<br>
           Padanaram, with his daughter Dinah: all the souls of his sons<br>
           and his daughters were thirty and three.</p>

<p> And the sons of Gad; Ziphion, and Haggi, Shuni, and Ezbon,<br>
           Eri, and Arodi, and Areli.</p>

<p> And the sons of Asher; Jimnah, and Ishuah, and Isui, and<br>
           Beriah, and Serah their sister: and the sons of Beriah; Heber,<br>
           and Malchiel.</p>

<p> These are the sons of Zilpah, whom Laban gave to Leah his<br>
           daughter, and these she bare unto Jacob, even sixteen souls.</p>

<p> The sons of Rachel Jacob's wife; Joseph, and Benjamin.</p>

<p> And unto Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and<br>
           Ephraim, which Asenath the daughter of Potipherah priest of On<br>
           bare unto him.</p>

<p> And the sons of Benjamin were Belah, and Becher, and Ashbel,<br>
           Gera, and Naaman, Ehi, and Rosh, Muppim, and Huppim, and Ard.</p>

<p> These are the sons of Rachel, which were born to Jacob: all<br>
           the souls were fourteen.</p>

<p> And the sons of Dan; Hushim.</p>

<p> And the sons of Naphtali; Jahzeel, and Guni, and Jezer, and<br>
           Shillem.</p>

<p> These are the sons of Bilhah, which Laban gave unto Rachel his<br>
           daughter, and she bare these unto Jacob: all the souls were<br>
           seven.</p>

<p> All the souls that came with Jacob into Egypt, which came out<br>
           of his loins, besides Jacob's sons' wives, all the souls were<br>
           threescore and six;</p>

<p> And the sons of Joseph, which were born him in Egypt, were two<br>
           souls: all the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into<br>
           Egypt, were threescore and ten.</p>

<p> And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face<br>
           unto Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen.</p>

<p> And Joseph made ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel<br>
           his father, to Goshen, and presented himself unto him; and he<br>
           fell on his neck, and wept on his neck a good while.</p>

<p> And Israel said unto Joseph, Now let me die, since I have seen<br>
           thy face, because thou art yet alive.</p>

<p> And Joseph said unto his brethren, and unto his father's<br>
           house, I will go up, and shew Pharaoh, and say unto him, My<br>
           brethren, and my father's house, which were in the land of<br>
           Canaan, are come unto me;</p>

<p> And the men are shepherds, for their trade hath been to feed<br>
           cattle; and they have brought their flocks, and their herds,<br>
           and all that they have.</p>

<p> And it shall come to pass, when Pharaoh shall call you, and<br>
           shall say, What is your occupation?</p>

<p> That ye shall say, Thy servants' trade hath been about cattle<br>
           from our youth even until now, both we, and also our fathers:<br>
           that ye may dwell in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is<br>
           an abomination unto the Egyptians.</p>

<p> Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, and said, My father and my<br>
           brethren, and their flocks, and their herds, and all that they<br>
           have, are come out of the land of Canaan; and, behold, they<br>
           are in the land of Goshen.</p>

<p> And he took some of his brethren, even five men, and presented<br>
           them unto Pharaoh.</p>

<p> And Pharaoh said unto his brethren, What is your occupation?<br>
           And they said unto Pharaoh, Thy servants are shepherds, both<br>
           we, and also our fathers.</p>

<p> They said morever unto Pharaoh, For to sojourn in the land are<br>
           we come; for thy servants have no pasture for their flocks;<br>
           for the famine is sore in the land of Canaan: now therefore,<br>
           we pray thee, let thy servants dwell in the land of Goshen.</p>

<p> And Pharaoh spake unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy<br>
           brethren are come unto thee:</p>

<p> The land of Egypt is before thee; in the best of the land make<br>
           thy father and brethren to dwell; in the land of Goshen let<br>
           them dwell: and if thou knowest any men of activity among<br>
           them, then make them rulers over my cattle.</p>

<p> And Joseph brought in Jacob his father, and set him before<br>
           Pharaoh: and Jacob blessed Pharaoh.</p>

<p> And Pharaoh said unto Jacob, How old art thou?</p>

<p> And Jacob said unto Pharaoh, The days of the years of my<br>
           pilgrimage are an hundred and thirty years: few and evil have<br>
           the days of the years of my life been, and have not attained<br>
           unto the days of the years of the life of my fathers in the<br>
           days of their pilgrimage.</p>

<p> And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and went out from before Pharaoh.</p>

<p> And Joseph placed his father and his brethren, and gave them a<br>
           possession in the land of Egypt, in the best of the land, in<br>
           the land of Rameses, as Pharaoh had commanded.</p>

<p> And Joseph nourished his father, and his brethren, and all his<br>
           father's household, with bread, according to their families.</p>

<p> And there was no bread in all the land; for the famine was<br>
           very sore, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of<br>
           Canaan fainted by reason of the famine.</p>

<p> And Joseph gathered up all the money that was found in the<br>
           land of Egypt, and in the land of Canaan, for the corn which<br>
           they bought: and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh's<br>
           house.</p>

<p> And when money failed in the land of Egypt, and in the land of<br>
           Canaan, all the Egyptians came unto Joseph, and said, Give us<br>
           bread: for why should we die in thy presence? for the money<br>
           faileth.</p>

<p> And Joseph said, Give your cattle; and I will give you for<br>
           your cattle, if money fail.</p>

<p> And they brought their cattle unto Joseph: and Joseph gave<br>
           them bread in exchange for horses, and for the flocks, and for<br>
           the cattle of the herds, and for the asses: and he fed them<br>
           with bread for all their cattle for that year.</p>

<p> When that year was ended, they came unto him the second year,<br>
           and said unto him, We will not hide it from my lord, how that<br>
           our money is spent; my lord also hath our herds of cattle;<br>
           there is not ought left in the sight of my lord, but our<br>
           bodies, and our lands:</p>

<p> Wherefore shall we die before thine eyes, both we and our<br>
           land? buy us and our land for bread, and we and our land will<br>
           be servants unto Pharaoh: and give us seed, that we may live,<br>
           and not die, that the land be not desolate.</p>

<p> And Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for the<br>
           Egyptians sold every man his field, because the famine<br>
           prevailed over them: so the land became Pharaoh's.</p>

<p> And as for the people, he removed them to cities from one end<br>
           of the borders of Egypt even to the other end thereof.</p>

<p> Only the land of the priests bought he not; for the priests<br>
           had a portion assigned them of Pharaoh, and did eat their<br>
           portion which Pharaoh gave them: wherefore they sold not their<br>
           lands.</p>

<p> Then Joseph said unto the people, Behold, I have bought you<br>
           this day and your land for Pharaoh: lo, here is seed for you,<br>
           and ye shall sow the land.</p>

<p> And it shall come to pass in the increase, that ye shall give<br>
           the fifth part unto Pharaoh, and four parts shall be your own,<br>
           for seed of the field, and for your food, and for them of your<br>
           households, and for food for your little ones.</p>

<p> And they said, Thou hast saved our lives: let us find grace in<br>
           the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh's servants.</p>

<p> And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt unto this day,<br>
           that Pharaoh should have the fifth part, except the land of<br>
           the priests only, which became not Pharaoh's.</p>

<p> And Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country of<br>
           Goshen; and they had possessions therein, and grew, and<br>
           multiplied exceedingly.</p>

<p> And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the<br>
           whole age of Jacob was an hundred forty and seven years.</p>

<p> And the time drew nigh that Israel must die: and he called his<br>
           son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in<br>
           thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal<br>
           kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt:</p>

<p> But I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of<br>
           Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will<br>
           do as thou hast said.</p>

<p> And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel<br>
           bowed himself upon the bed's head.</p>

<p> And it came to pass after these things, that one told Joseph,<br>
           Behold, thy father is sick: and he took with him his two sons,<br>
           Manasseh and Ephraim.</p>

<p> And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh<br>
           unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the<br>
           bed.</p>

<p> And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at<br>
           Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me,</p>

<p> And said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and<br>
           multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people;<br>
           and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an<br>
           everlasting possession.</p>

<p> And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born<br>
           unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into<br>
           Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine.</p>

<p> And thy issue, which thou begettest after them, shall be<br>
           thine, and shall be called after the name of their brethren in<br>
           their inheritance.</p>

<p> And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in<br>
           the land of Canaan in the way, when yet there was but a little<br>
           way to come unto Ephrath: and I buried her there in the way of<br>
           Ephrath; the same is Bethlehem.</p>

<p> And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these?</p>

<p> And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God<br>
           hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray<br>
           thee, unto me, and I will bless them.</p>

<p> Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not<br>
           see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them,<br>
           and embraced them.</p>

<p> And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy<br>
           face: and, lo, God hath shewed me also thy seed.</p>

<p> And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he<br>
           bowed himself with his face to the earth.</p>

<p> And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward<br>
           Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward<br>
           Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him.</p>

<p> And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon<br>
           Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon<br>
           Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was<br>
           the firstborn.</p>

<p> And he blessed Joseph, and said, God, before whom my fathers<br>
           Abraham and Isaac did walk, the God which fed me all my life<br>
           long unto this day,</p>

<p> The Angel which redeemed me from all evil, bless the lads; and<br>
           let my name be named on them, and the name of my fathers<br>
           Abraham and Isaac; and let them grow into a multitude in the<br>
           midst of the earth.</p>

<p> And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon<br>
           the head of Ephraim, it displeased him: and he held up his<br>
           father's hand, to remove it from Ephraim's head unto<br>
           Manasseh's head.</p>

<p> And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this<br>
           is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head.</p>

<p> And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know<br>
           it: he also shall become a people, and he also shall be great:<br>
           but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and<br>
           his seed shall become a multitude of nations.</p>

<p> And he blessed them that day, saying, In thee shall Israel<br>
           bless, saying, God make thee as Ephraim and as Manasseh: and<br>
           he set Ephraim before Manasseh.</p>

<p> And Israel said unto Joseph, Behold, I die: but God shall be<br>
           with you, and bring you again unto the land of your fathers.</p>

<p> Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren,<br>
           which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and<br>
           with my bow.</p>

<p> And Jacob called unto his sons, and said, Gather yourselves<br>
           together, that I may tell you that which shall befall you in<br>
           the last days.</p>

<p> Gather yourselves together, and hear, ye sons of Jacob; and<br>
           hearken unto Israel your father.</p>

<p> Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the beginning of<br>
           my strength, the excellency of dignity, and the excellency of<br>
           power:</p>

<p> Unstable as water, thou shalt not excel; because thou wentest<br>
           up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to<br>
           my couch.</p>

<p> Simeon and Levi are brethren; instruments of cruelty are in<br>
           their habitations.</p>

<p> O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their<br>
           assembly, mine honour, be not thou united: for in their anger<br>
           they slew a man, and in their selfwill they digged down a<br>
           wall.</p>

<p> Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce; and their wrath, for<br>
           it was cruel: I will divide them in Jacob, and scatter them in<br>
           Israel.</p>

<p> Judah, thou art he whom thy brethren shall praise: thy hand<br>
           shall be in the neck of thine enemies; thy father's children<br>
           shall bow down before thee.</p>

<p> Judah is a lion's whelp: from the prey, my son, thou art gone<br>
           up: he stooped down, he couched as a lion, and as an old lion;<br>
           who shall rouse him up?</p>

<p> The sceptre shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from<br>
           between his feet, until Shiloh come; and unto him shall the<br>
           gathering of the people be.</p>

<p> Binding his foal unto the vine, and his ass's colt unto the<br>
           choice vine; he washed his garments in wine, and his clothes<br>
           in the blood of grapes:</p>

<p> His eyes shall be red with wine, and his teeth white with<br>
           milk.</p>

<p> Zebulun shall dwell at the haven of the sea; and he shall be<br>
           for an haven of ships; and his border shall be unto Zidon.</p>

<p> Issachar is a strong ass couching down between two burdens:</p>

<p> And he saw that rest was good, and the land that it was<br>
           pleasant; and bowed his shoulder to bear, and became a servant<br>
           unto tribute.</p>

<p> Dan shall judge his people, as one of the tribes of Israel.</p>

<p> Dan shall be a serpent by the way, an adder in the path, that<br>
           biteth the horse heels, so that his rider shall fall backward.</p>

<p> I have waited for thy salvation, O LORD.</p>

<p> Gad, a troop shall overcome him: but he shall overcome at the<br>
           last.</p>

<p> Out of Asher his bread shall be fat, and he shall yield royal<br>
           dainties.</p>

<p> Naphtali is a hind let loose: he giveth goodly words.</p>

<p> Joseph is a fruitful bough, even a fruitful bough by a well;<br>
           whose branches run over the wall:</p>

<p> The archers have sorely grieved him, and shot at him, and<br>
           hated him:</p>

<p> But his bow abode in strength, and the arms of his hands were<br>
           made strong by the hands of the mighty God of Jacob; (from<br>
           thence is the shepherd, the stone of Israel:)</p>

<p> Even by the God of thy father, who shall help thee; and by the<br>
           Almighty, who shall bless thee with blessings of heaven above,<br>
           blessings of the deep that lieth under, blessings of the<br>
           breasts, and of the womb:</p>

<p> The blessings of thy father have prevailed above the blessings<br>
           of my progenitors unto the utmost bound of the everlasting<br>
           hills: they shall be on the head of Joseph, and on the crown<br>
           of the head of him that was separate from his brethren.</p>

<p> Benjamin shall ravin as a wolf: in the morning he shall devour<br>
           the prey, and at night he shall divide the spoil.</p>

<p> All these are the twelve tribes of Israel: and this is it that<br>
           their father spake unto them, and blessed them; every one<br>
           according to his blessing he blessed them.</p>

<p> And he charged them, and said unto them, I am to be gathered<br>
           unto my people: bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in<br>
           the field of Ephron the Hittite,</p>

<p> In the cave that is in the field of Machpelah, which is before<br>
           Mamre, in the land of Canaan, which Abraham bought with the<br>
           field of Ephron the Hittite for a possession of a<br>
           buryingplace.</p>

<p> There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife; there they<br>
           buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife; and there I buried Leah.</p>

<p> The purchase of the field and of the cave that is therein was<br>
           from the children of Heth.</p>

<p> And when Jacob had made an end of commanding his sons, he<br>
           gathered up his feet into the bed, and yielded up the ghost,<br>
           and was gathered unto his people.</p>

<p> And Joseph fell upon his father's face, and wept upon him, and<br>
           kissed him.</p>

<p> And Joseph commanded his servants the physicians to embalm his<br>
           father: and the physicians embalmed Israel.</p>

<p> And forty days were fulfilled for him; for so are fulfilled<br>
           the days of those which are embalmed: and the Egyptians<br>
           mourned for him threescore and ten days.</p>

<p> And when the days of his mourning were past, Joseph spake unto<br>
           the house of Pharaoh, saying, If now I have found grace in<br>
           your eyes, speak, I pray you, in the ears of Pharaoh, saying,</p>

<p> My father made me swear, saying, Lo, I die: in my grave which<br>
           I have digged for me in the land of Canaan, there shalt thou<br>
           bury me. Now therefore let me go up, I pray thee, and bury my<br>
           father, and I will come again.</p>

<p> And Pharaoh said, Go up, and bury thy father, according as he<br>
           made thee swear.</p>

<p> And Joseph went up to bury his father: and with him went up<br>
           all the servants of Pharaoh, the elders of his house, and all<br>
           the elders of the land of Egypt,</p>

<p> And all the house of Joseph, and his brethren, and his<br>
           father's house: only their little ones, and their flocks, and<br>
           their herds, they left in the land of Goshen.</p>

<p> And there went up with him both chariots and horsemen: and it<br>
           was a very great company.</p>

<p> And they came to the threshingfloor of Atad, which is beyond<br>
           Jordan, and there they mourned with a great and very sore<br>
           lamentation: and he made a mourning for his father seven days.</p>

<p> And when the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the<br>
           mourning in the floor of Atad, they said, This is a grievous<br>
           mourning to the Egyptians: wherefore the name of it was called<br>
           Abelmizraim, which is beyond Jordan.</p>

<p> And his sons did unto him according as he commanded them:</p>

<p> For his sons carried him into the land of Canaan, and buried<br>
           him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, which Abraham<br>
           bought with the field for a possession of a buryingplace of<br>
           Ephron the Hittite, before Mamre.</p>

<p> And Joseph returned into Egypt, he, and his brethren, and all<br>
           that went up with him to bury his father, after he had buried<br>
           his father.</p>

<p> And when Joseph's brethren saw that their father was dead,<br>
           they said, Joseph will peradventure hate us, and will<br>
           certainly requite us all the evil which we did unto him.</p>

<p> And they sent a messenger unto Joseph, saying, Thy father did<br>
           command before he died, saying,</p>

<p> So shall ye say unto Joseph, Forgive, I pray thee now, the<br>
           trespass of thy brethren, and their sin; for they did unto<br>
           thee evil: and now, we pray thee, forgive the trespass of the<br>
           servants of the God of thy father. And Joseph wept when they<br>
           spake unto him.</p>

<p> And his brethren also went and fell down before his face; and<br>
           they said, Behold, we be thy servants.</p>

<p> And Joseph said unto them, Fear not: for am I in the place of<br>
           God?</p>

<p> But as for you, ye thought evil against me; but God meant it<br>
           unto good, to bring to pass, as it is this day, to save much<br>
           people alive.</p>

<p> Now therefore fear ye not: I will nourish you, and your little<br>
           ones. And he comforted them, and spake kindly unto them.</p>

<p> And Joseph dwelt in Egypt, he, and his father's house: and<br>
           Joseph lived an hundred and ten years.</p>

<p> And Joseph saw Ephraim's children of the third generation: the<br>
           children also of Machir the son of Manasseh were brought up<br>
           upon Joseph's knees.</p>

<p> And Joseph said unto his brethren, I die: and God will surely<br>
           visit you, and bring you out of this land unto the land which<br>
           he sware to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob.</p>

<p> And Joseph took an oath of the children of Israel, saying, God<br>
           will surely visit you, and ye shall carry up my bones from<br>
           hence.</p>

<p> So Joseph died, being an hundred and ten years old: and they<br>
           embalmed him, and he was put in a coffin in Egypt.</p>
