The most difficult challenge so far in constructing this architecture is parsing each of the lines in the play and either representing each element as a well-formed Java object [see diagram c for an example line extraction] or discarding it as malformed. There are many edge cases in handling dialogue and stage directions which often have special characters that can get misrepresented.

We still need to improve the traversal architecture (as described in the previous section) to improve the precision of quote attribution. In particular, it is commonly the case that characterâ€™s names are listed in full at the beginning of a work, but only referred with aliases or abbreviations later. Currently, our system does not handle these cases gracefully and robustly. One potential solution we have considered is to use similarity metrics such as Levenshtein distance to determine these character aliases and abbreviations.
