\section{Introduction and Goals}
Our project builds on the work of Elson et al. in the extraction and construction of social networks from fictional works. Where the focus before has been on narrative works, such as in Elson, or biographical interviews, as in Jing et al., we focus our attention on plays and other theatrical works. In such works, the task of quote attribution is all but eliminated. Instead, the difficulty in determining social networks comes from the sparsity of non-dialogue text, which almost exclusively takes the form of stage directions.
